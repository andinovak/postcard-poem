**How this blog came about**

Strange times in 2020 and 2021 when staying at home was normal and going out 
was initially limited to an hour a day. The COVID -19 pandemic affected us all.

Overnight my 88 year old mother lost the few pursuits that gave her contact with others.
Her book club, craft club, meetings at the WI and seeing her family.  

The first lockdown of March - June 2020 was the hardest. She lived alone and due to 
her age was advised to shield. 
Once a week I dropped shopping off on her doorstep, stepped away and waved from afar.
During this time I decided to put pen to paper and write her a poem. 

Whilst researching local terms to use of her home town ‘Folkestone’ I came across a digital
copy of an old book called; 

Rambles around Folkestone & other special articles & notes by "Felix". 1914.

Felix was an ex-editor of the Folkestone Herald. (Kent UK)
My mother had lived in Folkestone all her life. It is where she and my father had courted.
I managed to obtain an original hard copy of the book online, the was repaired and musty 
but old and wonderful. I gifted this to my mother.

In the evenings she would phone me up and tell me she had been 
on a walk which would completely throw me into a panic until I realised 
it was in the comfort of her own home with this book in her hands. 

Being inspired by Felix and his Ramblings I decided to use the many photographs I had
taken as a prompt to create my own ‘ramblings’ and share them.
