title: Postcard Poems
welcome: >-
  Welcome.

  Postcards. Lovely to send, even lovelier to receive.

  Wanting to share the joy of a place, a moment in time.

  Or just for collecting to look back at happy memories.

  Explore and discover. Take five and enjoy.

  New postcards will be delayed over the next few months while I take the time to reorganise these pages. In the meantime, I will showcase some of my earlier postcards each week for you to enjoy.
