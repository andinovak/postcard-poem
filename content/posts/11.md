  “Parched after hot summer nights
  Leaves in the breeze wispy sprites
  Come dance in the shortening light
  Foresee the return of the Drellingore flight
  Ride the stream towards the sea
  Glide with abandonment, blissfully free”

  Aroused by dew drops on her lips
  The valley stirs beneath the mist
  Teasing the Drellingore with a wish
  To join her for a winter tryst

  Tempted by the valleys mirth
  The Drellingore stirs from beneath the earth
  Water crystal clear, cool and sweet
  Reach out to quench her thirsty feet

  The winterbourne ripples with pride
  The hills refreshed on either side
  Course swift awash with rain
  He vowed this year not to wane

  Winter tires and spring stirs
  Storms become but showers
  The valley where the lovers play
  Is green and budding with flowers

  The valley sighs and rests her head
  Near to the dwindling winterbourne bed
  The stream slows then flows no more
  Thank you, sleep well, my Drellingore
