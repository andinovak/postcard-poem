title: A Bit of Perspective
description: After visiting Langdon bay, I would often sit on top of the steep
  steps that lead down to the bay and watch the tide come in. A great place to
  be in tune with the world. It is hard to comprehend that the earth spins 1000
  miles per hour and we are being taken along for the ride. How awesome is that?

poem: |
  Is the sea a great big pool 
  that clings to a vast spinning ball
  Spinning so fast, if it were to stall
  would the sea become a waterfall?

  Are we ever the right way up 
  or on the very top of this gyrating prop?
  More likely we are sideways on,
  upside down, as we are spun around

  No wonder life can get a bit dizzy 
  Spinning so fast on a daily repeat
  as the world holds on tight to our feet.
  If it were to stop, off, we would drop.
