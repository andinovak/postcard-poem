alt: An old bridge, red bricks crumbling. railings rusted set against a stormy
  sky. A single boat is tied up to transport you.
poem: |
  A bridge to elsewhere, above or below
  Where will it take you, where will you go?

  Somewhere you’ve happily travelled before
  or somewhere new you’d like to explore

  Into the past where memories gleam
  Or Into the future of hopes and dreams

  Gaze at the bridge and in your mind's eye
  Take that first step, prepare to untie
  gently float beyond what is seen
  A bridge to elsewhere imagine and dream.

There are many grand bridges out there, beautiful and functional, then there are those bridges that are hidden and dreamy. I have a fancy these bridges can transport you elsewhere, just gaze with your mind's eye and find yourself wherever or whenever you want. Happy dreaming.
