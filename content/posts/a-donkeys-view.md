  Watching you watching me
  A stubborn creature some might see

  That's certainly not true.
  I just like to take in the view
  and think things through.

  I roam as free as any can
  In this micro-managed land
  I’m in no rush, why? are you?

  So as I stand and ponder
  Wondering where next to wander
  Maybe you should do the same
  and we can end this staring game.

  I have all the time in the world
  Do you? 
  So I say,
  “When you are ready, move on your way.”
