poem: |-
  Watching you watching me
  A stubborn creature some might see

  That's certainly not true.
  I just like to take my time 
  to think things through.

  I roam as free as any can 
  in this micro-managed land
  I’m in no rush, why? Are you?

  So as I stand and ponder, 
  wondering where next to wander.
  Maybe you should do the same
  and we can end this staring game.

  I have all the time in the world
  Do you? So I say,
  When you are ready, move on your way.

Delightful donkeys in the New Forest. This one was particularly cute. They always bring a smile to the face with their, “I’m not in a rush attitude”. They will happily stand their ground, be it on roads or paths, we once saw a group of donkeys bringing the village of Burley to a standstill, only ambling off when they were good and ready. How lovely to be so laid back.
