poem: |-
  Like swords, 
         shoots pierce the frozen land.
  Rising, 
         to make a stand. 
  A challenge,
         to winterâ€™s white.
  Flowering, 
         little lanterns of light.
  A hope,
         of snowdrops delights.
  Promising, 
         an end to the long cold nights.

A smile alights my face when I find the delicate snowdrop in our woodlands. Their green shoots are like little swords, breaking through the cold hard ground, challenging winter to a dual, making a stand and promising that spring will soon bring lighter warmer days.
