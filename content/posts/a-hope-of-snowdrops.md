  Sunlight between spindly trees
  Long shadows on fallen leaves

  Green shoots pierce the frozen earth.

  A hope of snowdrops brings light
  Soon, an end to long dark nights.

A smile alights my face when I find the delicate snowdrop in our woodlands. Their green shoots are like little swords, breaking through the cold hard ground, challenging winter to a dual, making a stand and promising that spring will soon bring lighter warmer days.
