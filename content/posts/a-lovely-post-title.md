  Some things are better when they are old. Things that were thought lost but
  then found come with a certain nostalgia.

poem: |
  If I could just pause and gaze
  out of a window every day
  This is the window I would choose
  with calming greens in the view
  What was lost is now found
  Echoes of the past surround
  Sea lavender drying overhead
  Rusted kettle on the ledge
  Yellowing paint grimy glass
  Verdigris on the brass
  I would shake my cares away and
  from this window pause and gaze.
