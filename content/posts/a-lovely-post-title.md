poem: |-
  Some things are better when they are old. 
  Things that were thought lost but then found
  come with a certain nostalgia. 
  A visit to the Lost Gardens of Heligan 
  is like stepping into a time portal to the past
  A simpler time, a harsher time a tragic time.
  Rediscovered and being restored 
  with renewed hope.
