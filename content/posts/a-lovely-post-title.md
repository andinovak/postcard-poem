poem: |-
  Silent in reflection
  Caught in contemplation
  Still waters capture stills
  That move as nature wills

  Blues and greys change hue
  Birds fly straight on through
  The sun pours molten gold
  Into cold water moulds

  Clouds drift in and out
  A breeze ripples all
  Pools full of sky
