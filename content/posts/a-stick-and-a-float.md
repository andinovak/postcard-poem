poem: |-
  Weave a way through reeds and sedge 
  come closer to the water's edge, peer
  deep in the reflections before they shift
  glance, an otherly world of eels and fish

  Navigate flat marshes under vast skies  
  watch a myriad of birds dip and dive
  See a sudden dart of electric blue
  of a kingfisher vanishing from view

  Spy grey herons on spindly legs
  being statues at the water's edge
  and just as still with a stick and a float
  a fisherman in a waterproof coat

  Hear whispers in the wavering reeds that
  disperse in the mists sowing dreams
  to the one in a boat holding the helm 
  claiming the waters as his realm

  Light bounces and plays morphing the days
  entrancing the dwellers of these waterways.
