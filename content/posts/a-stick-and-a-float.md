title: A Stick and a Float
description: >
  Many different dwellers live on or around the waterways that make up the
  beautiful Norfolk Broads. Some are residents all year round others are
  visitors that flock in the warmer months,  many will return again and again
  captivated by the magic they find that makes them feel as if they are in their
  own special realm. 

  ‘A stick and a Float’ is the first of a series of postcards sharing the joy that is the Norfolk Broads.

poem: |-
  Weave a way through reeds and sedge 
  come closer to the water's edge, peer
  deep in the reflections before they shift
  Glance an otherly world of eels and fish

  Navigate flat marshes under vast skies  
  watch a myriad of birds dip and dive
  See a dart of electric blue
  of a kingfisher vanishing from view

  Spy grey herons on spindly legs
  being statues at the water's edge
  and just as still with a stick and a float
  a fisherman in a waterproof coat

  Hear whispers in the golden reeds, dreams
  that disperse in the mists sowing seeds
  to the one in a boat holding the helm 
  claiming the waters as his realm

  Light bounces and plays morphing the days
  entrancing the dwellers of these waterways.
