poem: |-
  Blue satin, draped 
  across the woodland bed
  Bees disturb the silky heads 
  Heads bow gracefully 
  beneath the trees, 
  The bells might not chime
  but their fragrance 
  permeates the breeze.

It wouldn't be spring without bluebells, and I am a sucker for traipsing off to the woods each year in search of them.
The joy of finding a wood fragrant with bluebells never tires. Enjoy a moment in the woods.
