title: Fragrant Chimes
description: >-
  It wouldn't be spring without bluebells, and I am a sucker for traipsing off
  to the woods each year in search them.

  The joy of finding a wood fragrant with  bluebells never tires. Enjoy a moment in the woods.

poem: |-
  Blue satin, draped 
  across the woodland bed
  Bees disturb the silky heads 
  Heads bow gracefully 
  beneath the trees, 
  The bells might not chime
  but their fragrance 
  permeates the breeze.
