  Fragrant Chimes
  Blue satin, draped across the woodland bed
  Bees disturb the silky heads 
  Heads bow gracefully beneath the trees, 
  The bells might not chime
  but their fragrance permeates the breeze.

  Delicate Lace
  A mantle of intricate lace
  the wood anemone's shy embrace
  Demure, close to the ground 
  Smiles when the sun shines down.

  Tiny White Stars
  Ransoms in the warming spring sun
  Smothering the woodland, drenching the air
  Globes of tiny white stars where ever you gaze
  Floating above a green woollen baize
