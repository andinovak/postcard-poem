poem: |
  It is often March when we see 
  an abundance of these happy 
  flowers defying the last of the 
  cold winds. 
  Yet it is January that often sees 
  the first small bunches of daffodils
  in our shops, the flowers are all in 
  tight buds ready to explode into a 
  bunch of sunshine when placed
  indoors in a vase. How delightful.
