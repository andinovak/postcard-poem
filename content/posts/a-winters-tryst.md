title: A Winters Tryst
description: >-
  Something a bit whimsical for valentines, a simple love story, between a
  valley and its water source.

  The Alkham Valley is known as a dry valley, so I was surprised one year to see a stream running along the valley floor which increased in width throughout the winter months only to vanish in the spring.

  I had just had my first encounter with ‘The Drellingore’, a ‘winterbourne’ stream transient in nature, dependent upon the weather. It can be many years between its occurrence. I was captivated.

poem: |-
  Parched after hot summer nights
  The valley stirs in the shortening light
  Teasing the Drellingore with a wish
  To join her for a winters tryst
  Tempted by the valleys mirth
  Water trickles from beneath the earth
  Crystal clear, cool and sweet
  Reaching to quench her thirsty feet.

  The winterbourne ripples with pride
  The valley green on either side
  His course swift, awash with rain
  He vowed this year not to wane.

  Yet winter tires and spring stirs
  Storms become gentle showers
  Along the dwindling winterbourne bed
  the valley is budding with flowers
  The stream slows, then flows no more.
  Thank you, sleep well, my Drellingore.
