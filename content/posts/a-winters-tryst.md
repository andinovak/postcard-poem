  Aroused by dew drops on her lips
  The valley spirit stirs in the mist
  Teasing the Drellingore with a wish
  To join her for a winter tryst

  Tempted by the spirits mirth
  Water trickles from beneath the earth
  Crystal clear, cool and sweet
  Reaching out to caress her thirsty feet

  The winterbourne ripples with pride
  The valley refreshed either side 
  His course swift, awash with rain
  He vowed this year not to wane

  But winter tires and spring stirs
  Storms become but showers
  The valley where the water flows
  Now green, budding with flowers

  The spirit sighs and rests her head
  Near to the dwindling winterbourne bed
  The stream slows then flows no more
  Thank you, sleep well, my Drellingore.
