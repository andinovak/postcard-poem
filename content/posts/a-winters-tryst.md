poem: |
  Aroused by dew drops on her lips
  A spirit stirs in the valley mist
  Teasing the Drellingore with a wish
  To join her for a winter tryst.

  Tempted by the spirit's mirth
  Water trickles beneath the earth
  Crystal clear, cool and sweet
  Reaching to caress her thirsty feet.

  The winterbourne ripples with pride
  The valley spirit by his side
  His course swift, awash with rain
  He vowed this year not to wane.

  Yet winter tires and spring stirs
  Storms become gentle showers
  The valley where the lovers play
  is green and budding with flowers.

  The spirit sighs and rests her head
  Near to the dwindling winterbourne bed
  The stream slows, then flows no more
  Thank you, sleep well, my Drellingore.
