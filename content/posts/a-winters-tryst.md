  Parched after hot summer nights
  The valley stirs in the shortening light
  Teasing the Drellingore with a wish
  To join her for a winter tryst
  Tempted by the valleys mirth
  Water trickles from beneath the earth
  Crystal clear, cool and sweet
  Reaching to quench her thirsty feet.

  The winterbourne ripples with pride
  The valley refreshed on either side
  His course swift, awash with rain
  He vowed this year not to wane.

  Yet winter tires and spring stirs, 
  storms become gentle showers
  Along the dwindling winterbourne bed, 
  the valley is blooming with flowers
  The stream slows, then flows no more
  Thank you, sleep well, my Drellingore.
