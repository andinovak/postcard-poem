  winding it's way along the valley floor.
poem: >-
  The beautiful Alkham Valley is known as a dry valley so I was surprised one
  year to see a stream running along the valley floor, which increased in width
  throughout the winter months, only to vanish in the spring.

  I had just had my first encounter with ‘The Drellingore’, a ‘winterbourne’ stream transient in nature, dependent upon the weather. It can be many years between its occurrence. I was captivated.

Aroused by dew drops on her lips
The valley stirs beneath the mist.
Teasing the Drellingore with a wish
To join her for a winter tryst.

*“Parched after hot summer nights
Leaves in the breeze wispy sprites
Come dance in the shortening light
See the return of the Drellingore flight
Ride the stream towards the sea
Glide with abandonment, blissfully free”*

Tempted by the valley’s mirth
Water trickles from beneath the earth,
Crystal clear, cool and sweet
Reaching out to quench her thirsty feet.

The Winterbourne ripples with pride
The valley refreshed on either side 
His course swift, awash with rain
He vowed this year not to wane.

But winter tires and spring stirs
Storms become showers
The valley where the water flowed
is green and budding with flowers.

The valley sighs and rests her head
Near to the dwindling Winterbourne bed
The stream slows, then flows no more
Thank you, sleep well, my Drellingore.
