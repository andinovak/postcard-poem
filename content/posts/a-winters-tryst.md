  Aroused by dew drops on her lips
  The valley stirs beneath the mist
  Teasing the Drellingore with a wish
  To join her for a winter tryst

  “Parched after hot summer nights
  Leaves in the breeze wispy sprites
  Come dance in the shortening light
  See the return of the Drellingore flight
  Ride the stream towards the sea
  Glide with abandonment, blissfully free”

  ______________________________________

  Tempted by the valleys mirth
  Water trickles from beneath the earth
  Crystal clear, cool and sweet
  Reaching out to caress her thirsty feet

  The winterbourne ripples with pride
  The valley refreshed either side 
  His course swift awash with rain
  He vowed this year not to wane

  ------------------------------------------------------------

  But winter tires and spring stirs
  Storms become but showers
  The valley where the water flows
  is green and budding with flowers

  The valley sighs and rests her head
  Near to the dwindling winterbourne bed
  The stream slows then flows no more
  Thank you, sleep well, my Drellingore.
