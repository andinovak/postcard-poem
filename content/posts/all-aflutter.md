poem: |-
  The slopes are adrift 
  with grasses that quiver
  The slightest breeze sends them a dither
  Fragrant flowers amass on the slopes
  Waiting patiently for their butterfly hosts.

  As the sun's heat kisses the ground
  The Downs come alive, activity abounds.

  Glimpse flashes of flight 
  in the bright morning light,
  Dressed in blue, blue as the sky
  the lads bow to their ladies 
  who are dancing nearby, the
  ladies shimmer in gowns of brown
  All is aflutter 
  on the chalk hill Downs.

I would frequent Temple Ewell nature reserve on the North Downs to spot various butterflies and flowers throughout the seasons. Early summer was particularly rewarding. After the hot climb, I would sit quietly on a sheltered slope and watch. It never took long for a myriad of butterflies and other insects to frequent the abundant surrounding flowers.
One particular year the timing and weather were perfect, flying low over a sheltered slope were thousands of blue butterflies, it went from saying, there's one, there's one, to silence as it became apparent something rather special was happening. Being surrounded by so many delicate creatures at once was breathtaking.
