title: Beyond the Pebbles
description: Oldstairs Bay, Kingsdown in Kent. Sometimes the sands are there and
  sometimes not, but when they are as the tide falls away these images can be
  found. Forever shifting and changing. A gentleman I was talking to one early
  morning explained that the bay was on a bed of chalk so the rapid falling tide
  was unable to escape through this layer and bubbled back up leaving these
  fascinating artforms.

  Beyond the pebbles, the foreshore waits
  For the tide to unclasp its watery cape
  A land always there 
  but not always seen
  Of shifting sands and 
  shifting dreams

  As the tide eagerly draws away
  Murals appear on the sandy bay
  A fantastical display to surprise
  Explore, let imagination surmise.
