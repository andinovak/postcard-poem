title: Blackthorn Winter
description: This particular year the snow fell in early March. The blackthorn
  was in bloom indicating spring was ready to be embraced but winter had not
  entirely done with us. This is known as a blackthorn winter. Often there is a
  rivalry between the seasons as one season transitions into the other, but
  eventually, it is always the outgoing season that will give way letting the
  new season flourish. Our unpredictable weather will always keep us on our
  toes.

poem: |-
  Snow tumbled down, straight down
  Layer upon layer on the frozen ground
  No gentle wind to twirl and swirl
  No fierce wind to shift and drift
  Just straight down, cloaking all sound
  Out of the grey came white
  The day became quiet as night
  Layer upon layer, a heavy crown
  All around snow tumbled down
  Then
  The grey sky became blue
  What a glorious view
  Everywhere white, everywhere bright.
