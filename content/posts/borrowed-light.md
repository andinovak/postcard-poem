title: Borrowed Light
description: "As the sun sets in the west casting the last of its golden rays
  over Whitstable, the full moon rises east over Tankerton, sprinkling silver
  into the sea. Standing at the end of ‘The Street’  a pathway that opens up at
  low tide,  is a wonderful way to see the day gradually morph into the night.
  Sunset and moonrise, simultaneously.  "

poem: |-
  The sun blows a goodnight kiss
  embracing the moon with a gift 
  The gift of light to glow bright, a
  ghost light on the stage of night.

  Into twilight’s veil, moonlight spills
  Cascading over meadows and hills
  Stretching out shadows to fright
  Silhouetting owls in silent flight.

  The moon climbs higher, further, 
  diluting the dark
  Sweeping across towns and parks
  Over rooftops onto empty streets
  Stirring some from a dreamy sleep.

  Shining a path into the night
  with borrowed light, the 
  expansive moon gleams bright.
