poem: |-
  The sun blows a goodnight kiss
  embracing the moon with a gift 
  The gift of light to glow bright, a
  ghost light on the stage of night

  Into twilightâ€™s veil, moonlight spills
  Cascading over meadows and hills
  Stretching dark shadows to fright
  Silhouetting owls in silent flight

  The moon climbs higher, further 
  diluting the dark
  Sweeping across towns and parks
  Over rooftops onto empty streets
  Stirring some from a dreamy sleep.

  Shining a path with borrowed light
  The expansive moon glows bright.
