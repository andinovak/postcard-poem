title: Cauldrons of the Bay
description: >-
  These 'Cauldrons' are often found in Kingsdown bay, when they have finished
  bubbling they can leave behind

  imprints of what they have been creating. If you disturb them by standing in them your feet will sink into the sand. It is a bit of a shock when your foot suddenly disappears as you are walking along, a tug usually releases the foot (albeit now wet and slimy). Whilst most of the time they are pretty harmless creating some unusual art, on Halloween they like to have a little bit of fun.

alt: The imprint of a ghoulish face in the sand created by the tide retreating,
  sand bubbles up in watery cauldrons.
poem: |-
  A mischievousness comes into play
             that starts as the tide ebbs away
  leaving traps on the sandy ground
            “to the bay you could be bound’
  Whorls of sand grains swirling 
             captured as a cauldron churning
  “Careful of the charms they cast”
             don’t disturb them as you pass
  or your feet could be held fast.

  Halloween, the cauldrons still 
  In the sand, images to chill
  Imprints of monsters 
  unleashed to fright
  Keep safe dear friends
  on this Halloween night.
