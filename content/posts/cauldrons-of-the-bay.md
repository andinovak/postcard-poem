  A mischievousness comes into play
  that starts as the tide ebbs away
  leaving traps on the sandy ground
  “to the bay you could be bound’
  whorls of sand grains swirling 
  captured as a cauldron churning
  “careful of the charms they cast”
  don’t disturb them as you pass
  or your feet could be held fast.
