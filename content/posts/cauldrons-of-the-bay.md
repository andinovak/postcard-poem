title: Cauldrons of the Bay
description: >-
  These 'Cauldrons' are often found in Kingsdown bay, when they have finished
  bubbling they can leave behind

  imprints of what they have been creating. If you disturb them by standing in them your feet will sink into the sand. It is a bit of a shock when your foot suddenly disappears as you are walking along, a good tug usually releases the foot (albeit now wet and slimy) and the cauldrons carry on with their conjuring. Whilst most of the time they are pretty harmless on Halloween they like a little bit of fun.

poem: "A mischievousness comes into play

  \           that starts as the tide ebbs away

  leaving traps on the sandy ground

  \          “to the bay you could be bound’

  Whorls of sand grains swirling\ 

  \           captured as a cauldron churning

  “Careful of the charms they cast”

  \           don’t disturb them as you pass

  or your feet could be held fast.


  Halloween, the cauldrons still\ 

  \            in the sand, images to chill

  Imprints of monsters\ 

  \            unleashed to fright

  Keep safe dear friends

  \            on this Halloween night.
