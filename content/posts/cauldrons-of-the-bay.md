title: Cauldrons of the Bay
description: >
  These 'Cauldrons' are often found in Kingsdown bay, when they have finished
  bubbling they can leave behind

  imprints of the monsters they have been creating. If you disturb them by standing in them your feet will sink

  and could be held fast. It is a bit of a shock when your foot suddenly disappears as you are walking along, a good tug usually releases it and the cauldrons carry on with their conjuring.

poem: |-
  A mischievousness comes into play
             that starts as the tide ebbs away
  leaving traps on the sandy ground
            “to the bay you could be bound’
  whorls of sand grains swirling 
             captured as a cauldron churning
  “careful of the charms they cast”
             don’t disturb them as you pass
  or your feet could be held fast.

  When the water runs dry 
             and the cauldrons still 
  Left behind 
             are images to chill
  Imprints of monsters
             unleashed to fright
  Keep safe dear friends
             on this Halloween night.
