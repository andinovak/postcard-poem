  I chanced upon Kingsdown beach 
  tucked away on this easterly reach
  chasing the drama of a spring tide
  The waves were crashing and dutifully high 
  Yet it was the light bathing 
  this easterly reach
  that had me returning again and again
  The morning light soft yet bright.

  It was by chance, on one such trip that
  as the sun arose, the tide slipped away 
  revealing the most expansive bay
  I was captivated as the bay offered itself up
  For the briefest time in the early hours,
  I walked the bay, and the bay was all mine.
  I still chase the tides
  but the lowest of tides.

I have visited Kingsdown Beach many times over the past few years getting up at silly o'clock to greet the sunrise. I believe this little corner of Kent has the most beautiful morning light. When the spring tides go low, the bay is transformed but never consistent in its appearance. I would walk the bay as the tide went out, staying until the tides returned. These trips inspired a collection of poems called ‘Beyond the Pebbles’ which can be found on the collection pages. I am still adding to this collection, a work in progress. If you are not an early morning person, take a walk in the bay with these postcards and discover something magical.
