poem: |-
  Tucked away on this easterly reach
  I chanced upon Kingsdown beach
  Chasing the drama of a spring tide
  I hurried and lengthened my stride
  The tide was spectacularly high 
  Waves crashed far into the sky

  Yet it was the light bathing the coast
  that had me returning again and again
  The morning light, soft yet bright.

  It was by chance, on one such trip that
  as the sun rose, the tide slipped away 
  revealing the most expansive bay

  For the briefest time, I walked the bay
  captivated, and the bay was all mine.

I have visited Kingsdown Beach many times over the past few years getting up at silly o'clock to greet the sunrise. I believe this little corner of Kent has the most beautiful morning light. When the spring tides go low, the bay is transformed but never consistent in its appearance. I would walk the bay as the tide went out, staying until the tides returned. These trips inspired a collection of poems called ‘Beyond the Pebbles’ which can be found on the collection pages. I am still adding to this collection, a work in progress. If you are not an early morning person, take a walk in the bay with these postcards and discover something magical.
