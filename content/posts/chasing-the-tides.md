poem: |-
  Tucked away on this easterly reach
  I chanced upon Kingsdown beach
  Chasing the drama of a spring tide
  I hurried and lengthened my stride
  The waves were roaring, and dutifully high 
  Salty spray fell from the clear blue sky.

  But it was the morning light, 
  soft yet bright, that had me 
  returning again and again, and
  it was by chance, on one such trip 
  as the sun rose, the tide did slip
  revealing Oldstairs Bay, I walked the bay
  beyond the pebbles, and at that time
  the bay was all mine.

I have visited Kingsdown Beach many times over the past few years getting up at silly o'clock to greet the sunrise. I believe this little corner of Kent has the most beautiful morning light. When the spring tides go low, the bay is transformed but never consistent in its appearance. I would walk the bay as the tide went out, staying until the tides returned. These trips inspired a collection of poems called ‘Beyond the Pebbles’ which can be found on the collection pages. I am still adding to this collection, a work in progress. If you are not an early morning person, take a walk in the bay with these postcards and discover somewhere magical.
