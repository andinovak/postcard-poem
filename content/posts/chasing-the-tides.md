  I chanced upon Kingsdown beach 
  chasing the drama of a spring tide
  The waves were crashing and dutifully high 
  Yet it was the light bathing the beach that
  had me returning again and again
  What a sight, the morning light
  Washing over the sea, soft yet bright.

  It was by chance, on one such trip that
  as the sun arose, the tide slipped away 
  revealing the most expansive bay
  I was captivated as the bay offered itself up
  For the briefest time in the early hours,
  I walked the bay, and the bay was all mine.
  I was still chasing the tides
  but now it was for the lowest of tides.
