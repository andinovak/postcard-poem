poem: |-
  Fungi, beautiful and weird, 
  Unruly Old Manâ€™s Beard.
  Woodland creatures go about their chores 
  rummaging for winter stores.

  The canopy begins to fray 
  as  summer has cast away.

  Autumn snips the final threads and
  all around, tumbling down 
  a cloth of orange, red and golden brown.
  Layer upon layer shrouding the ground.

  A woodland proudly displaying its bounty
  active in preparation, storing in anticipation.
