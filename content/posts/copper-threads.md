  distorts the reflection, making it look like fire.
poem: |-
  Fungi, beautiful and weird, 
  Unruly Old Man’s Beard.
  Woodland creatures go about their chores 
  rummaging for winter stores.

  Summer has cast away, 
  the canopy begins to fray 

  Autumn snips the final threads and
  all around, tumbling down 
  a cloth of orange, red and golden brown.
  Layer upon layer shrouding the ground.

  A woodland proudly displaying its bounty
  active in preparation, storing in anticipation.

Autumn colours are reflected in the waters of Kearsney Parks. The park is beautiful whatever the season.
The low sun and the wind rippling the surface of the water made the vibrant autumn colours pop. It was as if copper threads had been woven into the tree’s canopies setting them ablaze. Mesmerizing.
