title: Copper Threads
description: >+
  The autumn equinox sees summer firmly on the back foot and although we may
  have warmth in the shortening days the colder nights begin to tell a different
  story. 

  Copper threads is part of a collection of poems called 'Woodland Tapestries'  

  I had this whimsical idea that the woodlands are worked on an ancient loom overseen by the seasons. 

  Autumn, Winter, Spring and Summer will be weaved in due course with some smaller tapestries linking the seasons together.

  Autumn has to work quite quick
  before the woodland 
  canopy bares its sticks
  Fine copper threads are 
  carefully chosen and 
  very skilfully interwoven
  setting the canopy 
  ablaze as the night 
  begins to outwit the day.
