title: Copper Threads
description: >
  The autumn equinox sees summer firmly on the back foot and although we may
  have warmth in the days the nights begin to tell a different story. 

  Copper threads is part of a collection of poems called 'Woodland Tapestries'  

  The idea is that the woodlands are worked on an ancient loom overseen by the seasons. 

  Winter, Spring and Summer will be weaved in due course.

  Autumn has to work quite quick
  before the canopy bares its sticks
  Fine copper threads are carefully chosen and 
  very skilfully interwoven, setting the tree tops 
  ablaze as the night begins to outwit the day.

  Fungi, beautiful and weird
  Unruly old man's beard
  Woodland creatures go about their 
  chores rummaging for winter stores
  Summer has cast away
  the canopy begins to fray.

  Autumn snips the final threads and
  all around tumbling down a cloth
  of orange, red and golden browns
  Layer upon layer shrouding the ground

  A woodland proudly displaying its bounty
  active in preparation, storing in anticipation.
