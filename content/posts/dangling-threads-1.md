  The woodlands loom starts to wake
  as winter removes its holding brake

  Day and night begin to balance
  A test is run, a simple valance

  Catkins unfurl swaying like threads
  dangling over the woodland bed

  A welcome frieze of yellow and green
  Heralding spring in bare winter scenes

Woodland Tapestries is a collection of photographs and poems showcasing our wonderful woodlands. I had this romantic notion that our woodlands were being woven on an ancient woodland loom, each season taking it in turn to weave its finest colours. Discover more woodland tapestries as we transition through the year.
