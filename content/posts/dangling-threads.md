title: There Then Not part three
description: >-
  The Goodwin Sands are sandbanks that shift and change keeping their secrets
  hidden. 

  To visit is like stepping into a different dimension, to write about them demanded so much more than a few lines. 

  The poem is in three parts. This is part three. Find part one and two in collections.

alt: Sandbanks, separated by deep pools of water, the sand has been worked into
  intricate patterns by the sea.
poem: |-
  We weren't fooled by the soulful pools
  The sculptured sands, a beauty wrought 
  by the restless sea, a jealous master 
  who guards, then strikes 
  extinguishing the lights of men
  binding crew and their doomed ships
  to the shifting sands, eclipsed.

  We left before the sea’s interception
  Bowed our heads in silent reflection
  A place of tragedy of many lives lost
  The Goodwin Sands are there….

  And then, they are not.
