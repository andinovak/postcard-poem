  Deal Pier not too long and not too wide
  Leisure seating stretches along the sides
  Straddling the sea on solid concrete legs
  Legs planted deep into the chalk seabed
  Quiescent as the rolling sea comes and goes
  Bearing the force of the tides ebb and flow
  Bathed in the suns first morning light 
  Cast in silhouette when the moon is bright
  Casually stroll the length of the pier
  where the salty sea air is refreshingly clear
  Gaze out to the ships moored in the Downs
  Gaze back towards delightful old Deal town.
