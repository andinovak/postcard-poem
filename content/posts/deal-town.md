poem: |-
  Deal town, not too big and not too small
  Fronted by pebbles and a low sea wall
  Named alleys lead to charming streets 
  Where houses lean and almost meet
  The town is steeped in villainous mystery 
  And awash with a colourful nautical history
  Has a castle built in the shape of a rose and 
  a memorial bandstand where music flows
  Fishing boats sit atop the shingle beach under
  skies that dominate this most easterly reach
  Deal town once punished and harshly plundered
  Lovingly nurtured, quaint, delightful and cultured.
