  Deal town not too big and not too small
  Fronted by pebbles and a low sea wall
  Named alleys lead to charming streets 
  Where houses lean and tightly meet
  Walmer beach blooms in spring, has 
  white beach huts and a picnic green

  The area is steeped in villainous mystery 
  And awash with a colourful nautical history
  Two castles built in the shape of a rose 
  A memorial bandstand where music flows
  Fishing boats sit atop the shingle beach under
  skies that dominate this most easterly reach
  The towns once punished and harshly plundered
  Lovingly nurtured, delightful and cultured.
