  Old Deal town, not too big and not too small
  Fronted by pebbles and a low sea wall
  named alleys lead to charming streets
  where houses lean and almost meet
  The town is steeped in villainess mystery 
  and awash with a colourful nautical history
  A memorial bandstand where music flows
  A castle beautifully built In the shape of a rose
  Fishing boats rest atop the shingle beach 
  Vast skies dominate this most easterly reach
  Deal town once punished and harshly plundered
  Lovingly nurtured, quaint, delightful and cultured.
