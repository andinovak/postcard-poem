title: Dew Pond
description: What a lovely name ‘Dew Pond’ we found this Dew Pond by accident
  after we had left the track to take shelter under an old crab apple tree. We
  weren't the only ones to seek shelter as we were soon joined by several New
  Forest ponies, who seemed a bit disgruntled to find us there and eyed us
  rather suspiciously from under their long lashes. As the heavens opened we all
  stubbornly stayed put. The shower soon moved on and as the ponies went one way
  we decided to go the other and there we found it, a delightful Dew Pond on top
  of a hill.

poem: |-
  A dew pond sits on top of the hill
  Amazing the water doesn’t spill
  Flashes of dragonflies pass us by
  Rouge rain clouds circle up high
  Around the pond sundews glisten
  and if we stand and carefully listen
  the only sounds we can hear
  are the soft thud of hooves
  somewhere near.
