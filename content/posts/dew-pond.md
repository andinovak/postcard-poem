title: Dew Pond
description: What a lovely name ‘Dew Pond’ we found this dew pond after we had
  left the track to take shelter under some old crab apple trees. We weren't the
  only ones to seek shelter as we were soon joined by several New Forest ponies,
  who seemed a bit disgruntled to find us there and eyed us rather suspiciously
  from under their long lashes. As the heavens opened we all stubbornly stayed
  put. The rain shower soon moved on and as the ponies went one way we decided
  to go the other where we found a delightful dew pond high up on the heath
  sheltered by prickly yellow gorse and fragrant heathers. Breathtaking.

poem: |-
  A dew pond sits far up on the hill
  Amazing the water doesn’t spill
  The heath dramatically drops away
  Pink heathers parade a colourful array
  Rogue rain clouds circle up high
  Flashes of dragonflies pass us by
  Around the pond sundews glisten
  and if we stand and carefully listen
  the only sounds we can hear 
  are of ponies munching somewhere near.
