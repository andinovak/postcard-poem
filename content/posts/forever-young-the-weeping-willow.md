poem: |-
  Forever young, as trees go
  a great age we shall never know.
  Forever young, we will stay
  and happily dance our years away.

  Supple limbs grace the ground
  Swing and sway, sweep around
  If we had toes or a nose,
  Sure, we could also touch those.

  At night when most are asleep
  We jig and thrash out a lively beat
  When the air calms and is still
  Maybe, just maybe 
  we will rest and chill

  Take a seat and sit awhile
  Hum a tune, that makes you smile
  If the tune is sad to hear
  we will weep away the tears,
  and if our branch should brush your arm
  we say with us, dance.

Some very fine weeping willow trees grace the banks of the River Stour in Sandwich Kent. Unlike the mighty Oak and long-lived Yews, the Weeping Willow has a relatively short life span of 30 to 50 years. As I wandered amongst these graceful trees a slight breeze caused the branches to swing and sway, which made me stop and smile, I had a fancy that they were asking me to join them in their dance.
