poem: |
  Forever young, as trees go
  a great age we shall never know
  Forever young, we will stay
  Dancing our youthful years away.

  Supple limbs reach the ground
  Swing and sway, sweep around
  If we had toes or a nose,
  Sure, we could also touch those.

  At night when we should be asleep
  We jig and thrash out a beat
  And when it happens the air is still
  Maybe, just maybe we will rest and chill

  Come on by and stop awhile
  Hum a tune that makes you smile
  If the tune is sad to hear
  we will weep away the tears.
  and as you brush by a branch
  We say, with us, dance.

Some very fine weeping willow trees grace the banks of the River Stour in Sandwich Kent. Unlike the mighty Oak and long-lived Yews, the Weeping Willow has a relatively short life span of 30 to 50 years. As I wandered amongst these graceful trees a slight breeze caused the branches to swing and sway, which made me stop and smile, I had a fancy that they were asking me to join them in their dance.
