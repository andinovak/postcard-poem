poem: |
  Sometimes my happy place is by the sea
  or in the woods hugging a tree.

  Today my happy place is ‘here’

  Finding the stillness within
  Feeling the air on my skin
  Sensing the energy around
  Sights, smells, sounds.

  The world cannot still it's beat
  But I can still my mind and feet

  I can feel a tickle of a breeze
  Hear birds happy in the trees
  See a butterfly passing by
  Smell the grass, drying nearby

  Be kind, to your amazing mind
  And a happy place you will find.
