poem: |-
  Sometimes my happy place is by the sea
  or in the woods hugging a tree.

  Today, my happy place is ‘here’.
  Looking far, and looking near.

  Finding the stillness within
  Feeling the air on my skin
  Sensing the energy around
  Sights, smells, sounds.

  The world cannot still it's beat
  but I can still my mind and feet.
  This happy place comes from within
  Being content with the little things.

The rolling hills on the Isle of Purbeck Dorset, this was an idyllic spot to sit and watch the steam trains of the Swanage Railway weave across the countryside. In the distance sits the dreamy ruins of Corfe Castle. As I sat  capturing the scene to take home, it struck me that I am easily content, another one to add to my growing list of ‘Happy Places’.
