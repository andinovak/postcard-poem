poem: |-
  Sometimes my happy place is by the sea
  or in the woods hugging a tree.

  Today, my happy place is ‘here’.
  Sitting, looking far and looking near.

  Finding the stillness within
  Feeling the air on my skin
  Sensing the energy around
  Sights, smells, sounds.

  The world cannot still it's beat
  but I can still my mind and feet.
  This happy place comes from within
  Being at one with the little things.
