poem: |-
  Gone fishing days are the best
  Days, that are truly blessed
  You hope, but never expect
  A perfect day in every respect.

  Most days come and go
  with nothing of note to show
  Other days, you'll chase away 
  a perfect storm to keep at bay.

  Then there are days you wish would linger onâ€¦..
  Days that make you skip and hum a song.

  Once hooked a piece stays in your heart and
  memories with which you would never part.
