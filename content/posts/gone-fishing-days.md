poem: |-
  Often, days are just okay
  Start bright then fade to grey.

  Darker days you’ll chase away
  Perfect storms to keep at bay.

  Then there are days you wish would linger on…..
  Days that make you skip and hum a song.

  I call these days ‘Gone Fishing Days’
  You hope but never expect
  Perfect in every respect.

  Once hooked, you reel it into your heart
  Memories to treasure and never part.
