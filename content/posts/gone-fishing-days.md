  Often, days are just okay
  Start bright then fade to grey.

  Darker days get chased away
  Perfect storms to keep at bay.

  Then there are days you wish would linger on…..
  Days that make you skip and hum a song.

  I call these days ‘Gone Fishing Days’
  You hope but never expect
  A perfect catch in every respect.

  Once hooked, you reel a piece into your heart
  Memories to treasure and never part.

  In the retelling, the story might grow
  But hey, your story, your show.

‘Gone fishing’ I love that expression, it conjures up peace, tranquillity and hope. Hope that maybe today is the day you’ll land the catch that you can talk about forever. Sometimes experiencing a perfect day, is like that, one that happens when you least expect it, where at the end of the day you take a deep sigh and say that was perfect, these are my ‘Gone Fishing Days’ The retelling of the story might involve a bit of artistic  licence and eventually hover between a dream and reality, but I think that is just perfect.
