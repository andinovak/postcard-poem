poem: |-
  Summer was holding on by its teeth
  as wild winds hurled across the beach,
  Sand grains raced and chased and stung
  across the dunes, hats were flung,
  Tall spiky marram grass held on fast 
  as the dunes were given a blast.

  But, summer was not yet done,
  It still had many weeks to run
  Taking to task the wild torment
  compelling the winds to relent.

  With a mischievous sigh, 
  the winds wave goodbye
  The clouds trail the winds
  The winds, for now, had given in.

Camber Sands, beautiful golden beaches, picturesque sand dunes and a lively sea, what I hadn’t bargained for on this lovely summer's day was the wind, and not just your gentle sea breeze, it was full on, hold onto your hat and anything else not pegged down kind of wind. I have lost quite a few hats this way. As the tide went out and as the sand dried, grains of sand raced as rivers across the beach. Quite exhilarating.
