  Summer was holding on by its teeth
  as wild winds hurled across the beach
  Sand grains raced and chased and stung
  across the dunes, hats were flung
  Tall spiky marram grass held on fast as
  all about, the sand dunes were recast.

  But, summer was not yet done,
  Golden rays burst from the sun
  daring the clouds to join the descent
  Compelling the winds to relent

  With a mischievous sigh, 
  the winds wave goodbye
  The clouds trailed the winds
  The winds, for now, had given in.

Camber Sands, beautiful golden beaches, picturesque sand dunes and a lively sea, what I hadn’t bargained for on this lovely summer's day was the wind, and not just your gentle sea breeze, it was full on hold onto your hats and anything else not pegged down kind of wind. I have lost quite a few hats this way. 

As the tide went out and as the sand dried, it lifted and raced as rivers across the beach. Quite exhilarating.
