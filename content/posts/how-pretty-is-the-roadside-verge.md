  How pretty is the roadside verge
  When flowers spill out of the earth
  In the garden, we call them weeds
  Not grown from hybrid seeds
  On the verge, they thrive and bloom
  So many flowers, with such little room
  So many colours, vibrant scenes
  against a canvas of blue and greens
  An abstract piece of beautiful art
  The roadside verge has my heart.

T﻿he longest night has passed and summer has taken a stand with an explosion of colour along the roadside verges, recently it has been the turn of the oxeye daisy to claim its summer spot. Their heads nod eagerly as you pass by as if saying “Hello it's summer at last.”
