  How pretty is the roadside verge
  When flowers spill out of the earth
  In the garden, we call them weeds
  Not grown from hybrid seeds
  On the verge, they thrive and bloom
  So many flowers, with such little room
  So many colours, a vibrant scenes
  Set against a canvas of blue and green
  An abstract piece of beautiful art
  The roadside verge has my heart.
