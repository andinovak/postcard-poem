  How pretty is the roadside verge
  When flowers spill out of the earth
  In the garden, we call them weeds
  Not grown from hybrid seeds
  On the verge, they thrive and bloom
  So many flowers, with such little room
  So many colours, a vibrant scene
  Reds and blues splashed with green
  An abstract piece of beautiful art
  The roadside verge has my heart.

  How Pretty is the 
  Roadside Verge
  Could be anywhere.
