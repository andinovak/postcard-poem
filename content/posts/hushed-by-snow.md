alt: A Cedar of Lebanon tree, branches are hanging, heavy with snow. Snow covers
  the ground.
poem: |-
  Delicate and light, snowflakes tumble down without breaking. 
  Layer upon layer, gradually claiming whatever they fall on,
  bringing a peace and quiet to the land. 
  Hushed by snow was inspired by a walk in the beautiful 
  Keasney parks in Dover. Even the evergreen trees appeared
  to be sleeping covered by this white blanket.
