title: Hushed by Snow
description: Haiku is a short Japanese, unrhyming poem capturing a moment in
  time. The poem is on the picture on the front of the postcard. I have written
  a brief description of where the inspiration for the poem came from on the
  main body of the postcard.

alt: A Cedar of Lebanon tree, branches are hanging, heavy with snow. Snow covers
  the ground.
poem: |-
  Delicate and light, snowflakes tumble down, 
  layer upon layer, catching each other as 
  they settle, bringing a peace and quiet to 
  the land. 
  Hushed by snow was inspired by a walk in 
  the beautiful Keasney parks in Dover. 
  Even the evergreen trees appeared to be 
  sleeping, covered by this white blanket.
