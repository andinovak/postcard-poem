  Delicate and light, snowflakes tumble down without breaking. 
  Layer upon layer, gradually claiming whatever they fall on,
  bringing a peace and quiet to the land. 
  Hushed by snow was inspired by a walk in the beautiful 
  Keasney parks in Dover. Even the evergreen trees appeared
  to be sleeping, wrapped in this white blanket.
