  This Magnificient tree named ‘Majesty’ is in Fredville Park Nonington Kent

  I had gone to the park to see the Sweet Chestnut ‘Step Tree’ resigning myself to the idea that seeing the Fredville Oak ‘Majesty’ was very unlikely as it is situated in a private area of the park.

  It was my husband who approached a worker (who was driving by on a tractor) who phoned the gamekeeper, who in turn escorted us to ‘Majesty’ The gamekeeper was very accommodating and informative about the park. A big thank you to this lovely man. We learnt that this great oak is thought to be over a thousand years. How humbling to make the acquaintance of one so old.

  and the midriff appears to have sagged.
poem: |-
  I have great age as you can see
  Green moss blankets my knees
  My limbs are heavy and prone to fall
  My midriff has sagged I’ve grown so tall
  My heartwood has shrunk
  Hollow now is my trunk
  Yet I do not mope
  I live the years with hope
  Each spring green leaves become my crown
  In autumn brown acorns cascade down
  I could be a thousand years or more
  Maybe there is alchemy at my core
  I am of great antiquity
  I stand with great dignity
  I am Majesty
