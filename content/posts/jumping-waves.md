poem: |-
  We were children again that day on the beach
  Jumping the waves and bathing our feet.

  We wrote names on the sand 
  and collected shells to decorate
   a ramshackle castle 
  we built with a moat
  so when the swash came
  it would fill 
  and away it would float.
  Laughing out loud at our silly jokes
  Not caring who saw us daft folks.
  Kids again that day on the beach
  Holding hands and baring our feet.
