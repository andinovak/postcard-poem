  We were children again 
  that day on the beach
  Jumping the waves and
  bathing our feet.

  Writing names on the sand 
  and collecting shells to 
  decorate a ramshackle castle we
  built with a moat so
  when the sea came it 
  would appear to float then
  watch it disappear under the waves 
  and laugh out loud at our silly joke.

  Not caring who saw so many daft folk
  Kids again that day on the beach
  Holding hands and bathing our feet.
