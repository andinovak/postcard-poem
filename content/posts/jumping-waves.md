poem: |-
  We were children again 
  that day on the beach
  Jumping the waves and bathing our feet.

  We wrote names on the sand 
  and collected shells to decorate
   a ramshackle castle 
  we built with a moat
  so when the swash came
  it would fill, and away it would float.
  Laughing out loud at our silly jokes
  Not caring who saw us daft folk.
  Children again that day on the beach
  Holding hands and baring our feet.

Every time I visited Cornwall it would steal a little bit of my heart, hiding the piece away, somewhere in the county enticing me back to visit. Holywell Bay has the colourful Atlantic as its backdrop, rolling surf, some really high sand dunes and a cave, maybe a little bit of my heart is hidden in the cave at Holywell Bay.
