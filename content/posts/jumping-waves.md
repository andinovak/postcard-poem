poem: |-
  We were children again that day on the beach
  Jumping the waves and bathing our feet.

  We wrote names on the sand 
  and collected shells to decorate
   a ramshackle castle 
  we built with a moat
  so when the swash came
  it would fill and away it would float.
  Laughing out loud at our silly jokes,

  Not caring who saw us daft folks
  Kids again that day on the beach
  Holding hands and showing our feet.

Every time we visited Cornwall it would steal a little bit of our hearts, hiding the pieces away, somewhere in the county making sure we would always be back to visit.
