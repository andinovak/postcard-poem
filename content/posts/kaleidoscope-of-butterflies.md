title: Kaleidoscope of Butterflies
description: >-
  I would frequent Temple Ewell nature reserve to spot various butterflies and
  flowers throughout the seasons. Summer was particularly special as the reward
  after the hot climb was to sit quietly on a sheltered slope and watch. It
  never took long for a myriad of butterflies and other insects to frequent the
  abundant surrounding flowers.

  One particular year the timing and weather were perfect, flying low over a sheltered slope were thousands of blue butterflies, it went from saying, there's one, there's one, to silence as it became apparent something rather special was happening. Being surrounded by so many gentle creatures at once was awe-inspiring.

poem: |-
  The slopes are adrift with grasses that quiver
  The slightest breeze sends them a dither
  Fragrant flowers amass on the slopes
  Waiting patiently for their butterfly hosts.

  As the sun's heat kisses the ground
  The Downs are alive, activity abounds.

  Glimpse flashes of flight 
  in the bright morning light,
  Dressed in blue, blue like the sky
  the lads bow to their ladies 
  who are dancing nearby, the
  ladies shimmer in gowns of brown,
  A kaleidoscope of butterflies
  aflutter over the Downs.
