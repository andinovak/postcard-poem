title: Kaleidoscope of Butterflies
description: >-
  Some life experiences can literally take your breath away in wonderment, one
  of mine was experiencing the emergence of thousands of little blue butterflies
  on the North Downs, and if I had to make a top ten of special experiences this
  would be way up there. 

  I would frequent Temple Ewell nature reserve at various times of the year to spot various butterflies and flowers throughout the seasons. Summer was particularly special as the reward after the hot climb was to sit quietly on a sheltered slope and watch, it never took long for a myriad of butterflies and other insects to frequent the abundant surrounding flowers.

  One particular year the timing and weather were perfect, as flying low over a sheltered slope were thousands of blue butterflies, it went from saying, there's one, there's one, to silence as it became apparent something rather special was happening. Being surrounded by so many delicate creatures at once was awe-inspiring.

  The slopes are adrift with grasses that quiver
  The slightest breeze sends them adither
  Fragrant flowers amass on the slopes
  Waiting patiently for their butterfly hosts.

  Weaving trails across the Downs
  rivers of white meander around,
  On paths of chalk, tread slow, tread light,
  Inhale and delight in a majestic sight.

  As the sun's heat kisses the ground
  The Downs are alive, movement abounds.

  Glimpse flashes of flight 
  in the bright morning light.
  Dressed in blue, as blue as the sky
  the boys bow to their ladies 
  who are dancing nearby, 
  the ladies shimmer in gowns of browns.
  A kaleidoscope of butterflies
  flutters low, over the Downs.
