title: Leap of Faith
description: It is always empowering to see a heron launch itself into the air
  with seemingly little effort. For a bird that looks almost prehistoric, its
  moves are very graceful and ballerina like, the heron's grey feathers shimmy
  around its body like a floaty chiffon wrap. The Norfolk Broads has many fine
  examples of herons, they are often found standing still as statues along the
  river banks with watchful eyes, ready to take flight in an instance.

poem: |-
  How do you fly with spindly legs
  dangling like wooden pegs
  and then land with such ease
  on bendy knees beneath the trees
  I marvel at your leap of faith 
  into the sky with such grace
  To be so bold and 
  change the view
  I wish I could leap like you.
