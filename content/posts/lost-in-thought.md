poem: |-
  Take my hand, walk by my side
  Beyond the door, I'll be your guide
  Leave behind what makes you doubt
  What makes you frown
  What makes you shout.

  Side by side, let us wander 
  In comfy silence, somewhere yonder.
  On soft sand or crisp white snow
  What makes you smile is where weâ€™ll go.

  Lost in thought, but not lost, no,
  Hand in hand, I won't let go
  'Somewhere' is where we will be
  Side by side, you and me.

These old doors are in the walls of Kearsney Parks in Dover, through them are childhood memories, where nothing was as it seemed. The gentle slopes of the park became hills to climb and then tracks to race down at speed. The lakes were seas to navigate with treasure to find. The wide girth of the trees would be used for games of hide and seek and the ruins with gushing water became ancient cities to explore. Most places seem smaller and changed when you visit as an adult, but I still experience the charm and magic I found as a child. I may not be running down the hills or looking for treasure but a gentle stroll through the timeless grounds is a tonic for the soul.
