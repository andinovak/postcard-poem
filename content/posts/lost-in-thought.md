poem: |-
  Take my hand, walk by my side
  Beyond the door, I'll be your guide
  Leave behind what makes you doubt
  What makes you frown
  What makes you shout.

  Side by side, let us wander 
  In comfy silence, somewhere yonder.
  On soft sand or crisp white snow
  What makes you smile is where weâ€™ll go.

  Hand in hand, I won't let go
  Lost in thought, but not lost, no,
  'Somewhere' is where we will be
  Side by side, you and me.
