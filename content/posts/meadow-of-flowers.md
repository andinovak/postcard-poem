title: Meadow of Flowers
description: Haiku is a short Japanese, unrhyming poem capturing a moment in
  time. The poem is on the picture on the front of the postcard. I have written
  a brief description of where the inspiration for the poem came from on the
  main body of the postcard.

poem: |-
  A summers walk across the chalkland 
  meadows in the north downs of Kent, 
  where an abundance of wildlife can
  be enjoyed. Escape into the countryside 
  with this haiku and enjoy 
  a moment of mindfulness.
