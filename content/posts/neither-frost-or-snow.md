title: Neither Frost or Snow
description: I am always cheered to see the first vibrant green catkins in the
  hedgerows, swaying defiantly against cold winter winds and a sure sign that
  spring will not be far behind. Then comes a most welcome sight that starts as
  tiny white specks, developing into a most beautiful display of blackthorn
  blossom, the blossom always out before the leaves, providing an early source
  of nectar and pollen for our bees. It also acts as a marker of where the sloes
  will be, come autumn.

poem: |-
  Catkins trumpet the approaching spring
  Swaying in tune to cold easterly winds
  As the sun thaws winter's sleepy spell
  Buds in the hedgerows gently swell

  Specks of white neither frost nor snow
  begin to claim the sparse hedgerows.

  Blackthorns stir as the days get longer
  buds pop open as the sun gets stronger.

  Blossoms that appear as a dusting of snow
  drumroll spring, in the ancient hedgerows.
