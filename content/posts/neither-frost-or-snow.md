poem: |-
  Specks of white neither frost nor snow
  begin to claim the sparse hedgerows.
  Blackthorns stir as the days get longer
  buds pop open as the sun gets stronger.
  Blossoms that appear as a dusting of snow
  a drumroll to spring, in the ancient hedgerows.

  As the first white blossoms start to fade
  Leaves unfurl in a Mexican wave
  Hedgerows thicken, life quickens
  Bees on blossoms, birds in nests
  Butterflies and insects full of zest
  Springâ€™s crowning glory steals best in show
  As garlands of May blossom drape
  across the ancient hedgerows.

As the spring equinox dawns near and the days are gradually lengthening, a most welcome sight occurs in our ancient hedgerows. Starting as tiny white specks, which swell and open into the most beautiful display of blackthorn blossom, the blossom, always out before the leaves, provides an early source of nectar and pollen for our early insect dwellers. It also acts as a marker of where the sloes will be, come autumn.
