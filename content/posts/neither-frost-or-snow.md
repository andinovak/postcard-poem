title: Neither Frost or Snow
description: I always watch out for that first glimpse of white in the
  hedgerows. What starts off as tiny white specks soon turns into an abundance
  of blackthorn blossom. The flowers always out before the leaves are a welcome
  sight and provide the early source of nectar and pollen for our bees.

  Catkins trumpet the approaching spring
  Swaying to the tune of easterly winds.

  As the sun thaws winter's sleepy spell
  Buds in the hedgerows gently swell.

  Specks of white neither frost nor snow
  begin to claim the sparse hedgerows.

  Blackthorns stir as the days get longer
  buds pop open as the sun gets stronger.

  Blossoms appear as a dusting of snow
  Spring has arrived in the ancient hedgerows.
