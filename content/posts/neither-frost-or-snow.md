title: Neither Frost or Snow
description: I am always cheered to see the blackthorn blossom arrive in the
  hedgerows. A most welcome sight that starts as tiny white specks, developing
  into a most beautiful display of flowers, providing an early source of nectar
  and pollen for our bees. It also acts as a marker of where the sloes will be,
  come autumn.

poem: |-
  Catkins trumpet the approaching spring
  Swaying to the tune of easterly winds.

  As the sun thaws winter's sleepy spell
  Buds in the hedgerows gently swell.

  Specks of white neither frost nor snow
  begin to claim the sparse hedgerows.

  Blackthorns stir as the days get longer
  buds pop open as the sun gets stronger.

  Blossoms appear as a dusting of snow
  Spring has arrived in the ancient hedgerows.
