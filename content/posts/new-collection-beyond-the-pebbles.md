poem: |-
  Been hidden from the light of day
  Carefully I dust the years away
  As I clean my thoughts go back
  Iâ€™m sitting on my grandmother's lap
  I learnt to sew on one like this
  I close my eyes clickety-click
  The needle chunters up and down 
  A rhythmic hypnotic sound
  The bullet shuttle hums to and fro
  Her foot works the treadle 
  I feel the flow
  Her gentle hands guiding mine 
  I learn to sew clickety-clack
  Sitting on my grandmother's lap.
