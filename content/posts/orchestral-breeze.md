  Wishing you all a happy new year 2023

  Six months have passed since setting up this blog. A big thank you for sharing this journey with me and taking the time to read my postcards, I have many more postcards to share. 

  New years day 2022 went down as the warmest on record in the UK and many took advantage of this, it was reported some even had barbeques. Most just took to their feet to get out and enjoy the unusually warm winter's day, clearing their heads of the last remnants of ‘Christmas fog.’

  Skies dotted with exuberant clouds
  Sunlight tangled in twigs and boughs
  An unusually warm orchestral breeze
  Serenading through leafless trees

  Blackbirds scratching on leafy tracks
  A watchful redbreast looking for snacks
  Dried reeds rustling aside still dykes 
  Reflections dipping far out of sight.

  People jogging, a new years mantra
  Some with headphones 
  Some with dogs
  Walkers dawdling, talking
  Clearing Christmas fog.
