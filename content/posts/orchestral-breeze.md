title: Orchestral Breeze
description: >+
  The years continue to pass from one to the other like a relay race. We say
  farewell to the old year and welcome in the new year. Maybe we are the batons
  being passed from one year to the next. Looking back, 2022 was very hot in the
  UK and new years day 2022 went down as the warmest on record, and many took
  advantage of this, it was reported some even had barbeques. Most just took to
  their feet to get out and enjoy the unusually warm winter's day, southerly
  winds brought the warmer air making the trees dance and sing. A glorious day
  to be out and about.

  Skies dotted with exuberant clouds
  Sunlight tangled in twigs and boughs
  An unusually warm orchestral breeze
  Serenading through leafless trees

  Blackbirds scratching on leafy tracks
  A watchful redbreast looking for snacks
  Dried reeds rustling beside still dykes 
  Swans glide in winter's low sunlight.
