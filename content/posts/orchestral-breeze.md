poem: |
  Skies dotted with exuberant clouds
  Sunlight tangled in twigs and boughs
  An unusually warm orchestral breeze
  Serenading through leafless trees

  Blackbirds scratching on leafy tracks
  A watchful redbreast looking for snacks
  Dried reeds rustling aside still dykes 
  Reflections dip far out of sight.

  People jogging, a new years mantra
  Some with headphones 
  Some with dogs
  Walkers dawdling, talking
  Clearing Christmas fog.
