title: Pools Full of Sky
description: >
  It always makes me stop in my tracks when I come across a pool full of sky. It
  is as if you could just step out and walk on air, if you did step out it would
  be wet feet and the illusion would vanish. Much better to have the sky at your
  feet, so near so far and enjoy the ethereal moment.

  and of puffy clouds in the pool.
poem: |-
  Silent in reflection
  Gaze in contemplation
  Still waters capture stills
  that move as nature wills
  Blues and greys change hue
  Birds fly straight on through
  The sun pours molten gold
  inside cold water moulds
  A breeze, ripples anew
  Veiling the scenic view
  Breaking the trance 
  of pensive glance
  Pools full of sky.
