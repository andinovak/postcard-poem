poem: |-
  The sky at your feet, shallow yet deep
  Silent in reflection
  Caught in perception 
  Still waters capture stills
  that move as nature wills
  Blue and grey change hue
  Birds fly straight on through
  The sun pours molten gold
  into cold water moulds
  A breeze ripples anew
  forever shifting the view
  Pools full of sky.
