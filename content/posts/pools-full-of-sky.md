title: Pools Full of Sky
description: >
  It always makes me stop in my tracks when I come across a pool full of sky,
  not only because I would get my feet wet and the illusion would vanish but
  because I love the idea of having the sky at my feet, so near yet so far. and
  enjoy the ethereal moment.

  and of puffy clouds in the pool.
poem: |-
  Silent in reflection
  Gaze in contemplation
  Still waters capture stills
  that move as nature wills
  Blues and greys change hue
  Birds fly straight on through
  The sun pours molten gold
  inside cold water moulds
  A breeze, ripples anew
  Veiling the scenic view
  Breaking the trance 
  of pensive glance
  Pools full of sky.
