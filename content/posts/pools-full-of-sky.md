title: Pools Full of Sky
description: >
  It always makes me stop in my tracks when I come across a pool full of sky. It
  is as if you could just step out and walk on air, if you did step out it would
  be wet feet and the illusion would vanish. Much better to have the sky at your
  feet, so near so far and enjoy the ethereal moment.

poem: |-
  The sky at your feet 
  Silent in reflection
  Caught in perception 
  Still waters capture stills
  that move as nature wills
  Blue and grey change hue
  Birds fly straight on through
  The sun pours molten gold
  into cold water moulds
  A breeze ripples anew
  forever shifting the view
  Pools full of sky.
