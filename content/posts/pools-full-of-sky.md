  Silent in reflection
  Caught in contemplation
  Still waters capture stills
  That moves as nature wills
  Blues and greys change hue
  Birds fly straight on through
  The sun pours molten gold
  Into cold water moulds
  Clouds drift into view
  A breeze ripples anew
  Caught in reflection
  Silent in perception
  Pools full of sky
