title: Pools Full of Sky
description: >
  It always makes me stop in my tracks when I come across a pool full of sky,
  not only because I would get my feet wet and the illusion would vanish but
  because I love the idea of having the sky at my feet, imaging I could just
  step out and walk on air, so near yet so far.

  and of puffy clouds in the pool.
poem: |-
  Silent in reflection
  Caught in contemplation
  Still waters capture stills
  that move as nature wills
  Blues and greys change hue
  Birds fly straight on through
  The sun pours molten gold
  inside cold water moulds
  A breeze, ripples anew
  Shifting the placid view
  Breaking the trance 
  of a pensive glance
  Pools full of sky.
