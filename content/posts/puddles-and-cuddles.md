  Spring rushes forth without restraint
  The gardens have no complaint
  Colours are fresh, all is green
  Everywhere joy to be seen
  Smell the air, smell the earth 
  Revell in delightful mirth
  See the bees actively gather, 
  Hear the birds renewed natter
  Watch the dog run and scatter.

  Big black clouds suddenly appear 
  April showers are gathering near
  Hear the splash, feel the spray
  Find the dog ready to play
  The largest puddles are the most fun
  Soggy wet cuddles are sure to come.
