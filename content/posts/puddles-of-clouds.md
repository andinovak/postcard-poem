  sweeping out to sea.
poem: |
  Puddles of clouds splash across the sky
  Some quite low, others up high
  Silently drifting on an unseen breeze
  Billowing as waves in a waterless sea

  Some clouds weep as they hurry by
  grey and sullen they will heartily cry.
  Others will keep a hold of their tears  
  as they morph across the sphere.

  Riding the tailwinds, surfing the blue
  Magical cloudscapes shift and renew
  Look up at the sky and wistfully ponder
  A waterless ocean of endless wonder.
