  Puddles of clouds splash across the sky
  Some quite low, others up high
  Silently drifting on an unseen breeze
  Billowing waves in a waterless sea

  Some clouds weep as they hurry by
  grey and sullen they will heartily cry.
  Others will keep ahold of their tears  
  as they shift shape across the sphere.

  Magical cloudscapes morph
  riding the tailwinds, surfing the blue
  In a waterless ocean with endless views.
