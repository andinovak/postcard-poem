poem: |-
  Puddles of clouds splash across the sky
  So much water floating up high
  Silently drifting on an unseen breeze
  Billowing as waves in a waterless sea

  Some clouds weep as they hurry by
  grey and sullen they will heartily cry.
  Others will keep hold of their tears  
  as they transfigure across the sphere.

  Riding the tailwinds
  Surfing the blue
  Magical cloudscapes
  Shift with each view.

Many a time I have looked up at the sky and cloud gazed, seeing all sorts of fantastical shapes. I was idly wandering across Minnis Bay in Birchington-on-Sea doing just this when a very ominous-looking cloud suddenly swept across the bay. I was not near any shelter at the time and was not prepared for wet weather so I resigned myself to getting soaked, but, the unpredictable nature of our British weather saw the cloud pass overhead with not a drop falling near me, how close was that?
