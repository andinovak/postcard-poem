poem: |
  
  Deal town not to big and not to small
  Fronted by pebbles and a low sea wall
  Named alleys lead to charming streets
  where tall houses lean and tightly meet
  The town is steeped in villainous mystery 
  And awash with a colourful nautical history
  Has a castle built in the shape of a rose 
  A memorial bandstand where music flows
  Fishing boats sit atop the shingle beach under
  skies that dominate this most easterly reach
  The town once punished and harshly plundered
  Lovingly nurtured, delightful and cultured.
