title: Blooming Lovely
description: Deal, Walmer and Kingsdown a triple helping of loveliness, one
  seamlessly flows into the other along this stretch of seafront. The beaches
  bloom with colour in spring. The fragrant, pink, white and red flowers of
  valerian are in abundance. Blooming Lovely

poem: |-
  Fronted by pebbles and a white sea wall
  Deal Town, not too big and not too small
  Named alleys lead to charming streets
  where tall houses lean and tightly meet
  The area is steeped in villainous mystery 
  and awash with a colourful nautical history
  Castles built in the shape of a rose 
  A memorial bandstand where music flows
  Fishing boats sit atop the shingle beach 
  under vast skies that dominate 
  this most easterly reach
  The town once punished and 
  harshly plundered
  Lovingly nurtured, delightful and cultured.
