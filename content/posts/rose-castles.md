description: Deal, Walmer and Kingsdown a triple helping of loveliness, one
  seamlessly flows into the other along this stretch of seafront. The beaches
  from Deal to Kingsdown bloom with colour in June.

  Deal town not too big and not too small
  Fronted by pebbles and a low sea wall
  Named alleys lead to charming streets
  where tall houses lean and tightly meet
  The area is steeped in villainous mystery 
  And awash with a colourful nautical history
  Has castles built in the shape of a rose 
  A memorial bandstand where music flows
  Fishing boats sit atop the shingle beach under
  skies that dominate this most easterly reach
  The town once punished and harshly plundered
  Lovingly nurtured, delightful and cultured.
