title: Silent Footsteps
description: This sea of blue caught my eye as I travelled to work one morning.
  As soon as the weekend was here I ventured to find out what it was. Waking
  with the sunrise I travelled to the field to discover a carpet of ground ivy
  and periwinkle with the odd buttercup thrown into the mix. I watched the field
  come awake as the sun rose, it was one of those rare mornings when the world
  just felt right. It was perfect.

  the sun rises peeping through the trees.
poem: |-
  The morning was gentle, kind
  easing the wool from the mind.

  Strolling amidst the violet-blue
  silent footsteps are wet with dew.

  Sunlight slips between the trees
  Gold drips from budding leaves.

  Early mists hover, then lift
  around me, a subtle warmth drifts.

  Looking up towards the sky
  a flock of birds pass by,

  and with the birds, my spirits soar
  I am awake and restored.
