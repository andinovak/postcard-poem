poem: |-
  The morning was gentle, kind
  easing the night from the mind.

  Strolling amidst the violet-blue
  silent footsteps, are wet with dew.

  Sunlight slips between trees
  gold slowly drips from their leaves.

  Early mists hover, then break
  A subtle warmth eases aches.

  Looking up towards the sky
  a flock of birds pass by,

  and with the birds, spirits soar
  awake and restored.
