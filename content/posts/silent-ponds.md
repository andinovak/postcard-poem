title: Silent Ponds
description: >
  Kearsney parks in Dover, the birds were certainly confused as they came into
  land and encountered ice instead of water. Those that had already landed had
  no interest in alerting their fellow birds of the ice and watched bemused as
  many of them became skittles in the subsequent landings of their feathered
  friends.
