  An offshore breeze.
  The smell of seaweed.

  Ice cream cones sticky and sweet
  drip, drip on hands and feet.

  Seashells held up to the ear
  the rushing tide sounds so clear.

  Warm plastic blow-up balls.
  Fish and chips, hunger calls.

  Pebbles skimming, one, two, threeâ€¦
  Plop, plop, plop, into the sea.

  Squeals, laughter, being bold,
  teeth chattering, the sea is cold.

  Suntan cream on warm skin. 
  Seagulls crying, what a din.

  Vinegar, cockles, whelks and prawns.
  End of the day, contented yawns.

A summer visit to the seaside at Hastings was always a special treat. The seafront has changed much over the years, the pier now sports some very trendy beach huts, their pastel colours reminiscent of old-fashioned sweets and the crazy golf has got far more sophisticated. Yet if you stop and close your eyes the smells and the sounds of the seaside remain as they did when I was a child. How comforting.
