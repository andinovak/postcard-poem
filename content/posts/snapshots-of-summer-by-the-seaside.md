  An offshore breeze
  The smell of seaweed

  Ice cream cones sticky and sweet
  Drip, drip on hands and feet.

  Seashells held up to the ear,
  The rushing tide sounds so clear.

  Warm plastic blow-up balls.
  Fish and chips, hunger calls.

  Pebbles skimming, one, two, threeâ€¦..
  Plop, plop, plop into the sea.

  Squeals, laughter, being bold
  teeth chattering, the sea is cold.

  Suntan cream on warm skin. 
  Seagulls crying, what a din.

  Vinegar, cockles, whelks and prawns
  End of the day, contented yawns.
