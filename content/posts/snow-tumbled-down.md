  Snow tumbled down, straight down
  Layer upon layer on the frozen ground
  No gentle wind to twirl and swirl
  No fierce wind to shift and drift
  Just straight down, cloaking all sound
  Out of the grey came white
  The day became quiet as the night
  The night became light as the day
  All around snow tumbled down.

  Then the grey sky became blue
  What  a glorious view
  Everywhere white, everywhere bright
  Time to put work things aside
  enjoy the wonderment of outside
