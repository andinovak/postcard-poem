  Snow tumbled down 
  Straight down
  Layer upon layer 
  on the frozen ground
  No gentle wind to twirl and swirl
  No fierce wind to shift and drift
  Just straight down
  Cloaking all sound
  Out of the grey came white
  colour drained from sight
  The day became like the night
  and the night became like the day
  in a washed out ghostly way
  All around snow tumbled down.
