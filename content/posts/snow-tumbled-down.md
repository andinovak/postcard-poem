  Snow tumbled down, straight down
  Layer upon layer on the frozen ground
  No gentle wind to twirl and swirl
  No fierce wind to shift and drift
  Just straight down, cloaking all sound
  Out of the grey came white
  Draining colour from sight
  The day became quiet as the night
  and the night became as the day
  washed out in a ghostly way
  All around snow tumbled down.

  Then the grey sky became blue
  A glorious view, everywhere white
  everywhere bright, time to put work 
  things aside, enjoy the wonderment
  Of outside
