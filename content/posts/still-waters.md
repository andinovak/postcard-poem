alt: A frozen Lake surrounded by snow, many birds have landed on the lake and
  stand bemused on the frozen water.
poem: Kearsney Parks in Dover, the birds were certainly confused as they came
  onto land and encountered ice instead of water. Those who had already landed
  had no interest in alerting their fellow birds of the ice and watched bemused
  as many became skittles in the subsequent landings of their feathered friends.
