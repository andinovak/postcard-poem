poem: |-
  The longest day the shortest night
  Spring relinquishes the shuttle's flight
  Summer slows the beating loom
  To a rhythmic hypnotic tune

  The canopy tightens up its seams
  a patchwork of verdant greens
  Shadows play a game of chase 
  under the leafy embrace.

  Along bright rides butterflies hurry  
  In shifting shade insects scurry
  Berries plump and nuts cluster in the  
  lengthening days of warmth and lustre.

  A woodland teaming with animation 
  enjoying a summer celebration.
