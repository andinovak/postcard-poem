  The longest day, the shortest night
  Spring relinquishes the shuttle's flight
  Summer slows the beating loom
  To a rhythmic hypnotic tune

  The canopy tightens up its seams
  a patchwork of verdant greens
  Shadows play a game of chase 
  under the canopy's leafy embrace.

  Along bright rides butterflies hurry  
  In shifting shade insects scurry
  Berries plump and nuts cluster in the  
  longer days of warmth and lustre.

  A woodland teaming with animation 
  enjoying a summer celebration.

Woodland Tapestries is a collection of photographs and poems showcasing our wonderful woodlands. I had this romantic notion that our woodlands were being woven on an ancient woodland loom, each season taking it in turn to weave its finest colours. Here is summer taking its turn at the loom.
Discover more woodland tapestries as we transition through the year.
