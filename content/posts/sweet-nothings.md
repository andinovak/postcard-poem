title: Sweet Nothings
description: >-
  Fredville Park Nonnington, where trees have been allowed to be trees and
  mature in all their finery. There are some very elderly sweet chestnut trees,
  their trunks have become gnarled and twisted in the most fantastical way.

  This couple stand quite close together, their crowns touching, how sweet is that?

poem: |-
  We have grown old together you and I
  Youâ€™ve lost your shape, but so have I.

  Our crowns have become intertwined
  We are no longer so well-defined.

  I whisper sweet nothings as we touch
  You quiver but never say much.

  Come autumn
  our leaves play chase as they fall.
  Sweet chestnuts 
  are happily gathered by all.

  We sleep naked together all winter long
  In spring we wake to the Cuckoos song.

  Many years have passed us by
  We still stand together you and I.
