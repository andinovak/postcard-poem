poem: |-
  We have grown old together you and I
  Youâ€™ve lost your shape, but so have I.

  Our crowns have become intertwined
  We are no longer so well-defined.

  I whisper sweet nothings as we touch
  You quiver, but never say much.

  Come autumn
  our leaves play chase as they fall.
  Sweet chestnuts 
  are happily gathered by all

  We sleepnaked together all winter long
  In spring we wake to the Cuckoo's song.

  Many years have passed us by
  We still stand together you and I.
