title: Swimming with Stars
description: "Weeks before any trip I always buy a paper map of the area and
  find myself poring over it to find places to visit. We visited the beautiful
  county of Dorset in 2019. The place name ‘Dancing Ledge’ on the Jurassic
  coastline captured my imagination. Our visit luckily coincided with an
  outgoing tide, where we watched a lone swimmer in the tidal pool on the ledge.
  This was something that had to be on my to-do list but we were unprepared for
  such an adventure that day. We finally returned in 2022, the sea was calm, the
  sun was bright and it appeared as if thousands of stars were playing chase in
  the sea. I swam in the tidal pool surrounded by stars, how heavenly. "

poem: |-
  Have the stars skipped down
  when the moon's not around
  to play on the sea 
  in a daytime breeze?
  Or maybe
  the sun has sprinkled glitter
  over the waves
  to glint and flitter as
  sparkling sun glitter.
  When the sun's asleep
  and the stars peep
  is it silver the moon spills 
  to make the sea shimmer 
  for the midnight swimmer?

  Possibly it is all three.
