alt: Chapman's pool, a tidal pool at Dancing Ledge Dorset, a lone swimmer,
  starbursts of sunlight dance on the water
poem: |-
  Have the stars skipped down
  when the moon's not around
  to play on the sea 
  in a daytime breeze?
  Or maybe
  the sun has sprinkled glitter
  over the waves
  to glint and flitter as
  sparkling sun glitter
  and when the sun sleeps
  and when the stars peep
  is it silver the moon spills 
  to make the sea shimmer 
  for the midnight swimmer?

  Possibly it is all three.
