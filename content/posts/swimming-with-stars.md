poem: |
  Have the stars skipped down
  when the moons not around?
  to play on the sea 
  in a daytime breeze

  Or maybe

  the sun has sprinkled glitter
  over the waves
  to glint and flitter as
  sparkling sun glitter

  And when the sun sleeps
  And the stars peep
  Is it silver the moon
  pours into the sea?
  to shatter and scatter
