  Have the stars skipped down
  when the moon's not around
  to play on the sea 
  in a daytime breeze
  Or maybe
  the sun has sprinkled glitter
  over the waves
  to glint and flitter as
  sparkling sun glitter
  And when the sun sleeps
  And the stars peep
  Is it silver the moon 
  spills onto the sea
  To make the sea shimmer 
  For the nighttime swimmer

  Possibly it is all three.
