title: The Abandoned House
description: |-
  A house sat behind an old flint wall 
  Abandoned, haunted? If I recall,
  A perfect place for a Halloween dare 
  Knock the door then run quite fast
  back down the old worn garden path.

poem: |-
  Peeping above an old flint wall
  Pretending to look for a missing ball
  A wall of glinting grey, black stones.
  Or were they bones?
  Broken and knobbly, of things unknown.
  Then,
  Stepping through the wrought iron gate 
  roughened, with old peeling paint.
  A gate stuck wide with crumbling rust 
  Or was it blood? 
  Dried to a thick red crust.
  Gingerly, 
  Making our way up the path,
  Pretending to look for the ball with a laugh,
  Passing overgrown beds of dead flower heads
  and brambles that scratched our spindly legs.
  Up,
  Steps to the wooden door, 
  Ivy trailing over the porch floor.
  A note above the knocker of a bear’s head,
  “Beware. “Knock me if you dare,” it said.
  Of course, 
  We dared, 
  One bang each. Bang. Bang.
  Laughing, exhilarated we turned and ran
  Down a path that now twisted and snaked,
  Turning legs to jelly, 
  Stirring dread in our belly
  Tripped by brambles
  Or were they bony hands?
  Grasping our feet as we ran in retreat.
  Dead flower heads nodding
  Or were they skulls? 
  Jaws hung open. Whispering, wait……wait…..
  as we ran towards the open gate.
  Stopped, 
  In our tracks by a thunderous groan
  Turning, nowhere to hide
  The door of the house was open wide

  A ball rolled down the steps,
  Is this what you came for? 
  Come and collect.
  Of course, we didn’t. 
  We screamed and fled.

In an overgrown garden, Bushy Ruff House sat abandoned and derelict for many a year. In recent years the house was demolished and the grounds were redeveloped. 
Every time we walked past the old house and the overgrown gardens it sparked my imagination, perfect for Halloween.
