title: The Absent Moon
description: You never know what you are going to find as quietly stroll along.
  Well imaging my surprise to find the moon not where it should be, up in the
  sky but trying to be incognito on the ground. I guess we all deserve a rest
  day.

  Every month it seems 
  the moon is on a mission 
  to wax and wane and then 
  be completely out of vision
  Where does the moon go 
  in that missing day?
  Well, today the moon 
  was resting in the bay
  Taking a day off 
  bathing on the ground
  quietly ignoring those
  that wandered around.
