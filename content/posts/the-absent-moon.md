description: You never know what you are going to find as quietly stroll along.
  Well, imagine my surprise to find the moon not where it should be, up in the
  sky but trying to be incognito on the ground. I guess we all deserve a rest
  day.

  seaweed for eyes and mouth and a long chalk nose
poem: |-
  Every month it seems 
  the moon is on a mission 
  to wax and wane and then 
  be completely out of vision
  Where does the moon go 
  in that missing day?
  Well, today I found 
  the moon bathing in the bay
  Taking a day off 
  resting on the ground
  Quietly incognito to those
  that wandered around.
