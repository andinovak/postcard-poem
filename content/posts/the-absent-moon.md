  Every month it seems 
  the moon is on a mission 
  to wax and wane and then 
  be completely out of vision
  Where does the moon go 
  in that missing day?
  Well, today the moon 
  was resting in the bay
  Taking a day off 
  bathing on the ground
  quietly ignoring those
  that wandered around.
