title: Incognito
description: You never know what you are going to find as you amble along. Well,
  imagine my surprise to find the moon not where it should be, up in the sky but
  trying to be incognito on the ground. I guess we all deserve a rest day.

alt: Oldstairs bay, in the sand is a large crater that looks like the moon,
  seaweed for eyes and mouth and a long chalk nose
poem: |
  Every month it seems 
  the moon is on a mission 
  to wax and wane and then 
  be completely out of vision
  Where does the moon go
  missing for a day?
  Well, today I found 
  the moon bathing in the bay
  Quietly observing those 
  that wandered around 
  Trying to be incognito 
  resting on the ground
