title: The Beat of Time
description: >-
  The full moon of August 2022 rose above the horizon sporting the colours of
  the sunset.

  We stayed late watching the moon turn from glorious orange hues to its more traditional white silver light.

  The night was warm and it was with reluctance we left. As we left the beach was lit up with lights, the moth man had come to survey migrating moths from across the channel, how wonderful.

poem: |-
  I have never been to space to
  look back at our blue planet's face
  But I have watched beautiful moons
  Wax and wane again and again
  In star-filled heavens where comets fly 
  and myths and legends traverse the sky
  A seemingly endless nightscape  
  where layer upon layer of stars shine 
  twinkling to the silent beat of time.
