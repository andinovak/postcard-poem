poem: |-
  Proud to signal the morning ahead 
  The sun rises eagerly out of his bed
  Expecting clouds to provide a drape
  to cover his modesty as he wakes, but,
  at times the clouds are off in a dream,
  not a cloud in the sky is to be seen,
  the sun turns red, then a blushing pink 
  Not having the time to stop and think,
  he reaches for his golden cloak and
  dresses in a single stroke, gradually
  it dawns on him that not many that day 
  will have risen so early to see him that way.

  Then, to keep him in his finest prime, 
  the sun has to retire each night on time,
  But the evening clouds are often late 
  which causes the sun to get irate 
  Slipping his gown, he smoulders red, 
  as he discreetly sets onto his bed
  The errant clouds, feel a tad abashed
  turn the sky a pretty orange and pink 
  as out of sight, the sleeping sun sinks.
