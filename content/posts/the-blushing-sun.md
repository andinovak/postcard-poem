poem: |-
  I am told the sun is very old
  and to keep him in his finest prime
  he has to retire each night on time.

  But the evening clouds are often late 
  which causes the sun to get irate 
  Slipping his gown, he smoulders red, 
  as he discreetly sets onto his bed
  The errant clouds, feeling a tad abashed
  turn the sky orange and pink 
  as out of sight, the sleeping sun sinks.
