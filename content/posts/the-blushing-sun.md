  as the sun dips, two swans glide across the water.
poem: |-
  Proud to signal the morning ahead 
  The sun rises eagerly out of his bed.
  The clouds hang out a floating drape
  to cover his modesty as he wakes, but,
  at times the clouds are off in a dream,
  not a cloud in the sky is to be seen.

  The sun burns red, then blushes pink,
  not having the time to stop and think
  he reaches for his golden cloak,
  dressing in a single stroke, gradually 
  it dawns on him not many that day 
  will have risen so early to see him that way.
  Then.
  To keep him in his finest prime
  the sun retires each night on time,
  But the evening clouds can be late 
  which causes the sun to get irate 
  Slipping his gown, smouldering red, 
  he discreetly sets onto his bed.

  The errant clouds, feeling a tad abashed
  turn the sky, pretty pink, as out of sight
  the naked sun doth sink.

After so much unseasonal weather this week I revisited one of my favourite sunsets, taken a few years ago looking across Horsey Mere, as soon as we had moored up for the night, camera in hand I found this spot and settled down. Soon to be joined by a couple sharing a hip flask. I was joined by my husband who handed me a mug of hot chocolate. 

No words were needed as the sun did its thing, gloriously. As the sun gradually disappeared two swans returned for the night. D.reamy.
