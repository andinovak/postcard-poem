  Proud to signal the morning ahead 
  The sun rises eagerly out of his bed
  Expecting clouds to provide a drape
  To cover his modesty as he wakes, 

  Sometimes the clouds are off in a dream
  Not a cloud in the sky is to be seen
  The sun turns red, then a blushing pink 
  He doesnâ€™t have the time to think
  Reaching for his golden cloak 
  he drapes it around him in a stroke.

  Then taking a pause to settle down,  
  now comfortable in his glowing gown
  It dawns on him that not many that day 
  will have risen so early to see him that way.

  Then to keep him in his finest prime, the sun
  has to retire each night on time.

  But, those evening clouds are often late 
  which causes the sun to get irate 
  Slipping his gown, he smoulders red, 
  as he discreetly sets onto his bed
  The errant clouds feel a tad abashed and
  turn the sky pink as the sun further sinks.
