alt: The sun sets over a body of water, orange, amber and red reflect the sky,
  as the sun dips, two swans glide across the water.
poem: |-
  Proud to signal the morning ahead 
  The sun rises eagerly out of his bed.
  The clouds provide a floating drape
  to cover his modesty as he wakes, but,
  at times the clouds are off in a dream,
  not a cloud in the sky is to be seen.

  The sun burns red, then blushes pink,
  not having the time to stop and think,
  he reaches for his golden cloak,
  dressing in a single stroke, gradually
  it dawns on him that not many that day 
  will have risen so early to see him that way.
  Then,
  To keep him in his finest prime
  the sun retires each night on time,
  But the evening clouds can be late 
  which causes the sun to get irate 
  Slipping his gown, smouldering red, 
  he discreetly sets onto his bed.

  The errant clouds, feeling a tad abashed
  turn the sky pretty pink as out of sight
  the naked sun doth sink.
