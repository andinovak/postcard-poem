  as the sun dips, two swans glide across the water.
poem: |-
  I am told the sun is very old
  an ancient orb of burnished gold.
  A glowing mantle is his gown.
  A fiery aura is his crown.

  To keep him in his finest prime
  the sun retires each night on time.

  The evening clouds gently billow 
  To provide the sun with a pillow.

  But the evening clouds can be late
  which causes the sun to get irate 
  Smouldering as he settles down
  a furious red, without his gown.

  The errant clouds, feeling a tad abashed
  turn the sky pretty pink as out of sight 
  the sun slowly sinks.

After so much unseasonal weather this week I revisited one of my favourite sunsets, taken a few years ago looking across Horsey Mere, as soon as we had moored up for the night, camera in hand I found this spot and settled down. Soon to be joined by a couple sharing a hip flask. I was joined by my husband who handed me a mug of hot chocolate. No words were needed, and as the sun did its thing, gloriously, two swans returning for the night glided across the mere, how dreamy was that.
