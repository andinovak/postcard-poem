title: Butterfly Song
description: Butterflies don't sing, yet they have such graceful movements in
  flight I think there must be a tune in their heads that they are dancing to.
  Maybe this is what they are working on when they are cocooned, their song to
  the world.

  Butterflies dance their song
  with iridescent wings
  A whimsical mime
  to a silent rhyme.

  They enter a stage 
  draped with flowers and trees
  Warm sunny skies
  and a gentle breeze.
