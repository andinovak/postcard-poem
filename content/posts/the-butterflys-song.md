title: Butterfly Song
description: Butterflies don't sing, but what they lack in sound they make up
  for with colourful shimmering wings. They have such random movements when
  flying I think there must be a song in their heads that they are dancing to.
  Our lovely white butterflies are particularly lively in flight never seeming
  to land, what a song they must be dancing to.

  It is with iridescent wings
  a butterfly sings
  A whimsical mime
  to a silent rhyme
  What may appear as 
  random flight
  Is the butterfly's song 
  danced in the warm sunlight.
