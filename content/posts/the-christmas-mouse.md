title: The Christmas Mouse
description: >-
  Seasons Greetings to all my readers.

  We were baffled as to why we kept finding the empty silver wrappers of the chocolate treats beneath the tree, my husband was convinced I was the guilty culprit until one morning we discovered a partially eaten chocolate with tiny tiny teeth marks, and I was vindicated.

  A big thank you to Nora who painted a portrait of the little mouse and allowed me to include it in the artwork for this postcard.

poem: |-
  A bold little mouse hid in a house 
  To shelter from winter’s cold
  At night when all where asleep the
  mouse did seek fallen crumbs to eat

  One midnight mission, into his vision
  There came a tree, indoors! 
  That tree hadn’t been there before 
  Just perfect to climb and explore

  His little nose started twitching
  What was that he was sniffing?
  Wrapped in silver something sweet 
  Could it be a chocolate treat? Yum

  Soon it was noticed with a small frown
  The silver wrappers littering the ground
  Who was eating the chocolate treats?
  Who was to blame? Was it a game

  One night the mouse tried to eat two
  The second one was too much to chew
  Not only the wrapper did the mouse drop 
  but also the chocolate with a nibbled top

  The next day the mystery was finally solved
  There was no doubt, with such tiny teeth
  A little mouse was eating
  the Christmas tree treats.
