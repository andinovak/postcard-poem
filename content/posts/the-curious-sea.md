  Curiosity got the better of the sea
  It  rose in a mist and rolled over the cliff
  The surf stopped pounding, the waves stilled 
  Over the land, the sea mist spilled.

  Silencing footsteps as around it patrolled
  Quietening voices as it probed people's souls
  Weaving its way through doorless remains,
  Leaving droplets of salt on the land's domain.

  All were in awe as the sea stalked the land
  The birds stopped singing,
  The bees stopped buzzing,
  and when all the espying was done
  the mist slipped quietly back 
  from where it had come. 

  As the surf started pounding 
  many had the same thought
  Wondering did the curious sea 
  find what it had sought?

The north coast of Cornwall where the roar of the Atlantic sea can be heard pounding against the rocky cliffs, and the surf can be seen rolling in one wave after the other, delighting beachgoers. On this particular clifftop walk it was with some bemusement we watched a sea mist roll in, quieting the waves, leaving those intent on surfing just bobbing around on a calm sea, everything just seemed to stop, waiting for the mist to do its thing and move on. It was ethereal.
