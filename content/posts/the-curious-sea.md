  Curiosity got the better of the sea
  It  rose in a mist and rolled over the cliff
  The surf stopped pounding, the waves stilled 
  as over the land, the sea mist spilled.

  Silencing footsteps as around it patrolled
  Quietening voices as it probed people's souls
  Weaving its way through doorless remains,
  Leaving droplets of salt on the land's domain.

  All were in awe as the sea stalked the land
  The birds stopped singing,
  The bees stopped buzzing,
  and when all the espying was done
  the mist slipped quietly back 
  from where it had come 
  and again, the sea became one.

  As the surf started pounding 
  many had the same thought
  Wondering did the curious sea 
  find what it had sought?
