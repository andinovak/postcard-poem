  Curiosity got the better of the sea
  It  rose up in a mist and rolled over the cliff
  The surf stopped pounding, the waves stilled 
  as over the land, sea mist spilled.

  Silencing footsteps as around it patrolled
  Quietening voices as it probed people's souls
  Weaving its way through doorless remains,
  Leaving droplets of salt on the lands domain.

  All were in awe as the sea stalked the land
  The birds stopped singing,
  The bees stopped buzzing
  and when all the espying was done
  it slipped quietly back from where it had come
  and again, the sea became one.

  As the surf started pounding, many had the same thought
  Wondering, did the curious sea find what it had sought?
