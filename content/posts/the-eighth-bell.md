title: The Bells of St Peters
description: >
  It has been a weekend where church bells have ringing out, rejoicing in the
  coronation of King Charles III.

  I recently visited St Peters Church in Sandwich, what a gem. Climbing the clock tower afforded some wonderful views and on the way up I learnt the bells have inscriptions on them, giving them a message to ring out. How cool is that?

poem: |-
  In this noble clock tower of mine
  My bells sound out 
  with the chime of time
  Inscribed in their hearts 
  is a message to sing
  of love and peace
  and cheerful things.
  The songs are rooted in my bones
  their purpose resonant in my stones.

  The eighth bell's beautiful tone
  Sounds at night to call you home
  The inscription is lost to the past
  so, for as long as the ringing lasts
  Find the purpose within your heart.
