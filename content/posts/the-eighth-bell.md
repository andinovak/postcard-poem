title: The Eighth Bell
description: >
  It has been a weekend where church bells have ringing out, rejoicing in the
  coronation of King Charles the III.

  I recently visited St Peters in Sandwich and climbed the tower. What a Gem to visit. Here I learnt the bells had inscriptions on them, giving the bells a purpose to ring out. How cool is that?

  My Bells have a purpose
  Inscribed on their hearts
  To cheerfully sing
  and rejoice in all things.

  Most of the bells no longer swing
  yet they are still able to ring
  Sounding out with each chime of time 
  in this noble clock tower of mine

  My eighth bell is still able to peal
  its beautiful tone, beckons home
  Alas, the inscription is lost to the past
  so, for as long as the ringing lasts
  the purpose of my eighth bell 
  you will find in your heart.
