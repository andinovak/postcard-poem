poem: |-
  In this noble clock tower of mine
  My bells sound out 
  with the chime of time
  Inscribed in their hearts 
  is a message to sing
  of love and peace
  and joyful things.
  The songs are rooted deep in my bones
  their purpose resonant in my stones.

  The eighth bell's beautiful tone
  Sounds at night to call you home
  The inscription, alas, is lost to the past
  so, for as long as the ringing lasts,
  It is for you to decide and tell
  the message of this noble eighth bell.

It has been a weekend where church bells have rung out, rejoicing in the coronation of King Charles III.
I recently visited St Peter's Church in Sandwich, what a gem. Climbing the clock tower afforded some wonderful views and on the way up I learnt the bells have inscriptions on them, giving them a message to ring out. How cool is that?
