poem: |-
  Hidden away in a cliff of chalk
  A shaft where armies walked
  A spiral stairway, times three
  Intertwined, a trinity.

  Walls whisper in the Grand Shaft 
  an echo of the distant of the past

  Rhythmic sounds through the lower arch 
  Footsteps as armies marched, 
  voices falling silent before the climb, 
  Then murmurs, counting, 
  202 steps, each staircase, each time.

  Standing in the well of light 
  I contemplate each spiral flight
  With each twist and turn I hear 
  their comradely and the fear

  The walls fall silent as I climb
  202 steps, each staircase, each time.
