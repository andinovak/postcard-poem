title: A Well of Light.
description: "What a fantastic bit of engineering, a triple spiral staircase,
  reaching up 140 feet, hidden in the beautiful white cliffs of Dover. A well of
  light cascades down the central shaft. How neat is that? "

poem: |-
  Hidden away in a cliff of chalk
  A shaft where armies walked
  A spiral stairway, times three
  Intertwined, a trinity.
   
  An echo of the distant past
  whispering in the Grand Shaft

  Rhythmic sounds through the lower arch 
  Footsteps as armies marched, 
  voices falling silent before the climb, 
  then murmurs, counting, 
  202 steps, each staircase, each time.

  Standing in the well of light 
  I contemplate each spiral flight
  With each twist and turn I hear 
  the comradely and the fear

  The walls remind me as I climb
  202 steps, each staircase, each time.
