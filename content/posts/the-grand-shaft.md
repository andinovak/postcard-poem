title: A Well of Light.
description: "What a fantastic bit of engineering. A triple spiral staircase,
  all three winding the same way around a central shaft, reaching up 140 feet.
  The Grand Shaft is hidden in the beautiful White Cliffs of Dover, illuminated
  by a well of light that cascades down the central shaft. How neat is that? "

  sky. Their are windows all the way to the top.
poem: |-
  Hidden away in a cliff of chalk
  A shaft where armies walked
  A spiral stairway, times three
  Intertwined, a trinity.
   
  An echo of the distant past
  whispering in the Grand Shaft

  Rhythmic sounds through the lower arch 
  Footsteps as armies marched, 
  voices falling silent before the climb, 
  then murmurs, counting, 
  202 steps, each staircase, each time.

  Standing in the well of light 
  I contemplate each spiral flight
  With each twist and turn I hear 
  the camaraderie and the fear

  I find myself counting as I climb
  202 steps, each staircase, each time.
