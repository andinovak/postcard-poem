poem: |
  The Sunny dandelion tries so hard
  To be loved as other plants are.

  Eager to please with a bright yellow mane
  They smile in the sun and close in the rain

  They dig their roots deep and spread their seeds far
  to show what a clever little plant they are.

  Truth be told, you are loved,

  You are loved by butterflies and bees
  and the child who spreads your delicate seeds, 
  with each tiny breath away they depart.
  Your dandelion clock is a work of art.
