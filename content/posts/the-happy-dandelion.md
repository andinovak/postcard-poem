poem: |-
  The happy dandelions try so hard
  To be loved as other plants are.

  Eager to please with 
  a bright yellow mane
  They smile at the sun
  and close in the rain.

  They dig their roots deep
  and spread their seeds far
  to show what a clever 
  little plant they are.

  Truth to tell, you are loved

  You are loved by butterflies and bees
  and the child who spreads your
  delicate seeds, with each tiny breath, 
  away they depart
  Your dandelion clock 
  is a work of art.
