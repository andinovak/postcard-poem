  I went down to the beach that day when the
  tide ebbed further than the chart displayed
  although it was March the cold winds were none 
  the sun was warm, there was a southerly breeze 
  high pressure depressed the silent sea. 

  The tide went low, exceptionally low.

  It was quiet peacefully quiet
  Very few it seemed had ventured out to 
  roam the sands not normally shown and 
  to marvel at their great reveal in that
  magical hour when the tide is still.

  Boom! The Cooling Towers doom

  The noise travelled across the bay
  That was why many had stayed away
  To witness the towers brought to 
  their knees, rubble and dust, a cheer, 
  then a sigh, sadness at their demise.

  Seconds was all it took a fleeting look

  Many missed seeing the lowest of low tides 
  and the loveliest of clear blue skies, 
  An hour or so shared by the fortunate few 
  that had ventured out and cared to tread on
  what was usually the hidden seabed.
