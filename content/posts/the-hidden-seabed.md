title: The Hidden Seabed
description: It has been eleven years since the Richborough towers were
  demolished. I was often asked if I was going to be there to grab a photo. I
  thought about it but as chance would have it the Sunday in question coincided
  with a predicted low spring tide. The low tide won and it turned out to be one
  of the lowest I have seen. Very few were down the beach that morning, most
  were off to see the towers demolished. The sound of which echoed over the bay.
  Discussing the tide with a gentleman I met, he said it was the lowest he had
  seen it for 20 years, explaining the high pressure had caused the tide to go
  out further than predicted. What is normally seen as pebbles and chalk beds,
  opened up as a vast area of sand, it was magical.

  I went down to the beach that day when
  the tower's demise echoed over the bay.

  It was March, cold winds were none
  The day was warm, with a southerly breeze
  High pressure depressed the silent sea

  The tide went low, exceptionally low.

  Many had witnessed the towers 
  bought to their knees with
  a cheer, then a sigh
  as rubble and dust filled the sky.

  Few it seemed had ventured out 
  and cared to tread 
  on what was usually the hidden seabed
  To marvel at their grand reveal
  in that magical hour 
  when the tide is still.

  The tide went low, exceptionally low.
