  I was down the beach that day, the day
  the tide ebbed further than the chart displayed
  Although it was March the cold winds were none
  the sun was warm, with a southerly breeze
  High pressure had depressed the silent sea
  The tide went low, exceptionally low.
  Very few it seemed had ventured to roam 
  on the sands not normally shown 
  and marvel at their great reveal 
  in that magical time when the tide is still.

  Boom, the largest noise travelled across the bay, 
  and it was clear why many had stayed away
  Gone to witness the Richborough chimneys
  brought to their knees, 
  rubble and dust hung in a breeze, 
  blocking out the clear blue skies 
  with cheer, then sadness on their demise.

  Many missed the lowest of low tides 
  and the loveliest of clear blue skies, 
  which was shared by the fortunate few 
  that had stepped out and cared to tread 
  on what was usually the hidden seabed.
