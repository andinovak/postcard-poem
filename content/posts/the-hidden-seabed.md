title: The Hidden Seabed
description: >
  Eleven years have passed since the Richborough towers were demolished, and I
  was often asked if I was going to be there to grab a photo. I thought about it
  but as chance would have it, the Sunday in question coincided with a low tide
  in Kingsdown bay, which turned out to be one of the lowest I have seen so far.
  Very few were down the beach that morning, and discussing the tide with a
  gentleman I met, he said it was the lowest he had seen it for 20 years,
  explaining the high pressure had caused the tide to go out further than
  predicted. It was magical.

  I went down to the beach that day when
  the tower's demise echoed over the bay.

  It was March, cold winds were none
  The day was warm, with a southerly breeze
  High pressure depressed the silent sea

  The tide went low, exceptionally low.

  Many had witnessed the towers 
  bought to their knees
  a cheer, then a sigh
  as rubble and dust filled the sky.

  Few it seemed had ventured out 
  to tread on the usual hidden seabed
  To marvel at their grand reveal
  in that magical hour 
  when the tide is still.

  The tide went low, exceptionally low.
