title: The Hidden Seabed
description: >-
  It has been eleven years since the Richborough cooling towers were demolished.
  Very few were down the beach that Sunday morning, it seemed many had gone to
  see the tower's demise. The sound of the explosion echoed over the bay. 

  Discussing the tide with a gentleman I met, he said it was the lowest he had seen it for 20 years, explaining the high pressure had caused the tide to go out further than predicted. What is normally seen as a pebble beach with chalk beds at Kingsdown in Kent, opened up as a vast area of sand, it was magical.

poem: |-
  I went down to the beach that day
  the tower's demise echoed over the bay.

  It was March, cold winds were none
  The day was warm, with a southerly breeze
  High pressure depressed the silent sea

  The tide went low, exceptionally low.

  Many had gone to see the cooling 
  towers bought to their knees 
  with a sudden cheer, then a sigh
  as rubble and dust filled the sky.

  Few it seemed had ventured out 
  and cared to tread 
  on the unhidden seabed
  To marvel at their grand reveal
  in that magical hour 
  when the tide is still.

  The tide was low, magically so.
