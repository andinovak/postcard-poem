title: The Loveliest Prize
description: Getting up to see the sunrise takes a commitment at any time of the
  year, but it is made easier during late autumn and the winter months by the
  later sunrises. The payoff is the much colder mornings. Yet it is these cold
  clear mornings that afford some of the most vibrant colours, rewarding those
  who have stumbled out of bed early enough to catch it.

  Look to the horizon 
  see the mighty sun soar
  Reflecting rich colours on
  waved-washed shores
  Fiery reds mellow into blushing pinks
  Molten gold softens with amber hints
  The earliest mornings
  and the shifting tides
  Gifts the early riser 
  The loveliest prize.
