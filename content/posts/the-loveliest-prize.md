  on the horizon, passing the sun.
poem: |-
  Look to the horizon 
  see the mighty sun soar
  Reflecting rich colours on
  waved-washed shores
  Fiery reds mellow into blushing pinks
  Molten gold softens with amber hints
  The earliest mornings
  and the shifting tides
  Gifts the early riser 
  The loveliest prize
