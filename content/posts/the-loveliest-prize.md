title: The Loveliest Prize
description: Getting up to see the sunrise takes a commitment at any time of the
  year, but it is made easier during autumn and the winter months by the sun
  rising that bit later, the payoff is the much colder mornings. Yet it is these
  cold clear mornings that afford some of the most vibrant colours, rewarding
  those who have stumbled out of bed early to capture it 'The Loveliest Prize'

  Look to the horizon 
  see the mighty sun soar
  Reflecting rich colours on
  waved washed shores
  Fiery reds mellow 
  into blushing pinks
  Molten gold softens 
  with amber hints
  The earliest mornings
  and the shifting tides
  Gifts the early riser 
  The loveliest prize.
