poem: |-
  Seagulls patter the ground with their feet
  Tap dancing it seems but it is all a deceit
  They pitter and patter again and again
  Tricking the worms, sounding like rain.
  Up the worms pop expecting some air, 
  unaware of the fate that awaits them there,
  A hungry gull with a bright yellow bill
  Wiggle away fast little worms
  before the gulls have their fill.
