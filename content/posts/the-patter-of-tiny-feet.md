title: The Patter of Tiny Feet
description: >-
  Have you ever seen a seagull working the ground with its feet? It certainly
  looks as if they are tap dancing. Sorry to say they are not, they are tricking
  the worms to come up to the surface. 

  Clever seagulls, poor worms.

poem: |-
  Seagulls patter the ground 
  with their feet
  Tap dancing it seems
  but it is all a deceit
  They pitter and patter 
  again and again
  Tricking the worms,
  sounding like rain.
  Up the worms pop 
  expecting some air, 
  unaware of the fate 
  that awaits them there,
  A hungry gull 
  with a bright yellow bill
  Wiggle away little worms
  before the gulls have their fill.
