poem: |-
  Silence fell on the longest of nights
  Extinguishing sound. Bringing light.

  Silence fell like a blanket of peace 
  Soothing the soul, bringing release.

  Silence fell as a gentle caress,
  Calming the body, easing stress.

  Silence fell far and deep,
  Lulling minds to restful sleep.

  Silence weighed heavily down,
  Holding its breath on the ground.

  Layer upon layer upon layer.
  Answering a child's simple prayer.
  “Oh, please let it snow”.

On this particular year, overnight snow closed many roads including Whitfield Hill. What a novelty to walk down the centre of this usually busy road, while a courageous workforce worked tirelessly at trying to clear it. Many families took advantage of this 'Snow day' to dust off their sleighs and embrace the opportunity to have. fun.
