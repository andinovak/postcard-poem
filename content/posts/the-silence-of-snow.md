poem: |-
  Silence fell on the longest of nights
  Extinguishing sound. Bringing light.

  Silence fell like a blanket of peace 
  Soothing the soul, bringing release.

  Silence fell as a gentle caress,
  Calming the body, easing stress.

  Silence fell far and deep,
  Lulling minds to restful sleep.

  Silence weighed heavily down,
  Holding its breath on the ground.
  Layer upon layer upon layer,

  Answering a child's simple prayer.
  “Oh, please let it snow”.
