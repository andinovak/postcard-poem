  Summers tap tapping at the woodland gate
  Hurry hurry spring flowers the trees won't wait

  Paled bluebells past their prime
  lingering, still fragrantly chime

  Ransoms stars, losing their shine 
  going to seed its almost time.

  Most spring flowers are back to sleep
  Safe in the woodland bed to keep

  Hurry hurry spring flowers the trees won’t wait
  They’re busy getting ready to fasten and drape 
  over the woodland their green summer cape.
