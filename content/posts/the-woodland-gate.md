  Summers tap tapping at the woodland gate
  Hurry hurry spring flowers the trees won't wait
  Paled bluebells past their prime
  lingering, still fragrantly chime
  Ransoms stars, losing their shine 
  going to seed its almost time
  Most spring flowers are back to sleep
  Safe in the woodland bed to keep
  Hurry hurry spring flowers the trees wonâ€™t wait
  they are getting ready to fasten and drape 
  over the woodland their green summer cape.
