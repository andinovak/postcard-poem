title: The Woodland Gate
description: "Our woodlands have undergone a major transformation since winter
  retreated. The last few weeks of spring are in our midst and we say goodbye to
  the colourful display of flowers that have graced the woodland floor. It
  always amazes me that nature knows just what to do and when. "

  Summers tap tapping at the woodland gate
  Hurry hurry spring flowers the trees won't wait.

  Paled bluebells past their prime
  lingering, still fragrantly chime.

  Ransoms stars, losing their shine 
  going to seed its almost time.

  Most spring flowers are back to sleep
  safe in the woodland bed to keep.

  Hurry hurry spring flowers the trees wonâ€™t wait
  they're getting ready to fasten and drape 
  over the woodland their green summer cape.
