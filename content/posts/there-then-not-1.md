title: There Then Not part two
description: >-
  The Goodwin Sands are sandbanks that shift and change keeping their secrets
  hidden. 

  To visit is like stepping into a different dimension, to write about them demanded so much more than a few lines. 

  The poem is in three parts. This is part two

poem: |-
  Respectfully we trod the sands
  Forever mindful of those who had
  gone before and what could ensue 
  If we overstayed this precious tour.

  We saw no ghosts, heard no eerie sighs
  No ringing of bells in the distant swell
  Just beautiful sands for miles and miles
  Peaceful, surreal, virgin land each tide
  Were we being mesmerised?
