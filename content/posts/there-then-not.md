title: There Then Not
description: >-
  The Goodwin Sands are sandbanks that shift and change keeping their secrets
  hidden. 

  To visit is like stepping into a different dimension, to write about them demanded so much more than a few lines. 

  An insert of the poem is on the postcard. I have included the full poem underneath.

  We saw no ghosts heard no eerie sighs
  No ringing of bells in the distant swell
  Just beautiful sands for miles and miles
  Peaceful, surreal, virgin land each tide
  Were we being mesmerised?

  We weren't fooled by the soulful pools
  The sculptured sands, a beauty wrought 
  by the restless sea, a jealous master 
  who guards, then strikes 
  extinguishing the lights of men
  binding crew and their doomed ships
  to the shifting sands, eclipsed.
  A place of tragedy of many lives lost
  The Goodwin Sands are there…..
  And then..... they are not.

Read the full poem here.

Lashed with rain on our outward ride we arrived under thunderous skies
Flanked by inquisitive seals our first glimpse of the sandbanks chilled
Surrounded by the unpredictable sea would it swallow us up or let us be?

With trepidation, we stepped ashore, trespasses on these famed sands
The sun appeared, a rainbow transpired
An amnesty? We hoped while the tide had other shores to scope.

Respectfully we trod the sands forever mindful of those who had
gone before and what could ensue if we overstayed our precious tour.

We saw no ghosts, heard no eerie sighs
No ringing of bells in the distant swell
Just beautiful sands for miles and miles
Peaceful, surreal, virgin land each tide
Were we being mesmerised?

We weren't fooled by the soulful pools
The sculptured sands a beauty wrought 
by the restless sea, a jealous master 
who guards, then strikes 
extinguishing the lights of men
binding crew and their doomed ships
to the shifting sands, eclipsed.

We left the sands before the seas interception
Bowed our heads in silent reflection
A place of tragedy of many lives lost
The Goodwin Sands are there….   and then, they are not.
