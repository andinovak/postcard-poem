title: There Then Not
description: >-
  The Goodwin Sands are sandbanks that shift and change keeping their secrets
  hidden. 

  To visit is like stepping into a different dimension, to write about them demanded so much more than a few lines. 

  This is part one

poem: |-
  Lashed with rain on our outward ride 
  We arrived under a thunderous sky
  Flanked by inquisitive seals, our first
  glimpse of the sandbanks chilled
  Surrounded by the unpredictable sea
  Would it swallow us up or let us be?

  With trepidation, we stepped ashore
  Trespasses on these famed sands 
  The sun appeared, a rainbow transpired 
  An amnesty? We hoped 
  While the tide had other shores to scope.
