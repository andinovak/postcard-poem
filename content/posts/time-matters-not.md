title: Time Matters Not
description: >
  Cedar of Lebanon, one of many magnificent trees that stand in the grounds of
  Kearsney Parks all sporting a favourite spot.

  We visited as children, we took our own children, and now enjoy the parks with the grand children. The parks have had a make over in recent years but still retain the magic that has delighted through the years, it is indeed a favourite spot where time matters not.

poem: |
  A tree stood content in its favourite spot
  Standing still for so long time was forgot
  The tree grew strong the tree grew tall
  A fine place to stand and survey all 
  The tree knew that time mattered not
  Standing quite still in its favourite spot.
