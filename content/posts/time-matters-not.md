title: Time Matters Not
description: >
  The Cedar of Lebanon is just one of many magnificent trees that stand on the
  grounds of Kearsney Parks, all sporting a favourite spot.

  We visited as children, we took our children, and now enjoy the parks with the grandchildren. Recently the parks have had a makeover and I am sure many more will find the magic that has delighted through the years, it is indeed a favourite spot where time matters not.

poem: |
  A tree stood content
  in its favourite spot
  Standing still for so long 
  time was forgot
  The tree grew strong 
  the tree grew tall
  A fine place to stand 
  and survey all 
  The tree knew that time matters not
  Standing quite still in its favourite spot.
