title: Tiny White Stars
description: You'll never forget your first encounter with a woodland full of
  Ransoms. The scent of the flowers on a sunny spring day is unmistakably
  garlic, and whether you love the smell or not, there is no denying the beauty
  of the profusion of tiny white stars that are their flowers.

  Crushed green velvet draped 
  on the woodland floor,
  above which globes of 
  tiny white stars soar.
  Ransoms where ever
  you stare
  smothering the woodland
  drenching the air
