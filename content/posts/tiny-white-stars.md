  Crushed green velvet 
  spread on the woodland floor
  above which globes of 
  tiny white stars soar
  Ransoms in the warming sun
  Smothering the woodland,
  drenching the air where ever
  You stare.

  Ransoms in the warming spring sun
  Smothering the woodland, drenching the air
  Globes of tiny white stars where ever you gaze
  Floating above a green woollen baize
