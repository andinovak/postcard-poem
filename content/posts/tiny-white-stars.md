title: Tiny White Stars
description: You'll never forget your first encounter with a woodland full of
  Ransoms. The scent of the flowers on a sunny spring day is unmistakably
  garlic, and whether you love the smell or not, there is no denying the beauty
  of the profusion of tiny white stars that hover above their vibrant leaves,

poem: |-
  Crushed green velvet draped 
  across the woodland floor,
  above which globes of 
  tiny white stars soar.

  Ransoms where ever you stare, 
  intoxicating, drenching the spring air.
