  Summer had been a bit tricksy
  The winds had been very ditsy.

  When autumn thought it had the spot
  The weather turned incredibly hot
  The sun opened up the furnace door 
  and out, it’s latent heat did pour.

  The land, too green to scorch
  basked under the fiery torch
  The grass kept growing, 
  We all kept mowing.

  Summer was finally making a stake 
  With autumn saying hurry up mate,
  You are out of turn and a tad too late.

  Feeling pleased with its final fling
  Summer reluctantly started giving in.

You’ve got to love our British weather.
After a promising start in June, the summer of 2023 kind of fizzled out in July and August. While we watched the continent bask in outrageously high temperatures, we weathered a much cooler climate with menacing winds fronting rain storms. Then in September, the sun finally decided to give us summer, jammed into the first few weeks of autumn. How crazy was that? We were in the beautiful New Forest camping at the beginning of September as it turned unseasonably hot. In the heat of the day, we walked across the very open Ashley Walk Bombing Range, after which seeking a shady spot was the order of the day, the same shady spots coveted by the wise New Forest ponies.
