  Summer had been a bit tricksy
  The winds had been very ditsy

  Just as we thought that was our lot
  The weather turned incredibly hot
  The sun opened the furnace door 
  and out latent heat did pour.

  The land was too green to scorch
  revelled under the fiery torch.
  The days were hot and balmy,
  the nights, humid and clammy.

  Summer was finally making a stake 
  if a tad too short and a tad too late.

  Feeling pleased it had done its bit
  Summer felt it was time to split.

Youâ€™ve got to love our British weather. After a promising start in June, the summer of 2023 kind of fizzled out in July and August. While we watched the continent bask in outrageously high temperatures we weathered a much cooler climate with menacing winds fronting the most amazing rain storms. Be careful what you wish for comes to mind when in September the sun finally decided to give us summer, jammed into a week. How crazy was that?
