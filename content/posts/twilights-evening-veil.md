poem: |-
  As the sun dips, to be elsewhere
  Twilight drapes through the air.
  A delicate veil, an ethereal sheen
  The realm of the in-between.

  Neither the day nor the night
  Not quite dark, yet not bright.
  Moments of quiet as the air stills
  The time before darkness spills.

  Into this magical evening light
  Stars emerge, pulsing bright.
  Gaze at the first star to gleam,
  Make a wish, share your dream.

We have often visited the Norfolk Broads in March and September when sunrises and sunsets happen at more sociable hours, as does twilight, whether it be morning twilight or evening twilight. The in-between, neither night nor day. During this magical light, the vast Norfolk skies and corresponding reflections morph most spectacularly and can take your breath away.
