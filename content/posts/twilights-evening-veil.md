  The magical light of twilight in the evening before the blanket of night is
  pulled across the sky.

poem: |-
  As the sun dips, to be elsewhere
  Twilight drapes through the air.
  A delicate veil, an ethereal sheen
  The realm of the in-between.

  Neither the day nor the night
  Not quite dark, yet not light.
  A place that quiets as the air stills
  The time before darkness spills.

  Into this magical light, the first
  star emerges, pulsing bright.
  Make a wish, share your dreams,
  with the stars as they gently gleam.

We have often visited the Norfolk Broads in March and September when sunrises and sunsets happen at more sociable hours, as does twilight, whether it be morning twilight or evening twilight. The in-between, neither night nor day. In this magical time, the vast Norfolk skies and corresponding reflections morph in the most spectacular way and can literally take your breath away.
