title: Washer Woman
description: You can tell that it is almost winter when The Beast from the East
  starts to enter the weatherman's repertoire. There is always an amusing
  variety of words when describing the weather, especially when the locality
  gets put into the pot. The Folkestone Washer Woman is one of a few terms used
  to describe the heavy rain clouds that chase in from the channel and if you
  get caught outside on one of their wash days you are in for a soaking. The
  Picture is of the old signal box at Folkestone Harbour station looking across
  to the north downs before the redevelopment of this area. I remember as a
  child standing on the pier and watching the boat trains arrive at the harbour
  station, one particular time I saw a girl about my age in a smart coat with a
  little suitcase by her feet, how exotic I thought as I dreamed about her
  destination.

poem: |
  I doubt it will snow 
  but I donâ€™t really know
  Gales could blow from the east
  bringing the beast
  Or blow from the north 
  hurling chill winds forth
  Milder air from the south 
  and rain from the west
  might follow the Downs' hilly crest
  Then again, making it pour
  we could endure the 
  Folkestone-washerwomen 
  doing their chores

  But It will be a delight if;

  Following a clear starry night
  the sun shines beautifully bright 
  Jack frost leaves patterns of lace
  coaxing a smile to a cold ruddy face
  We can hear bird songs so precise 
  And berries covered in ice

  However the weathervane spins
  and whether we are outside or in
  Mother nature
  the child in our heart sings.
