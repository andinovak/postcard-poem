title: The Folkestone Washer-Women
description: You can tell that it is almost winter when The Beast from the East
  starts to enter the weatherman's repertoire. There is always an amusing
  variety of words when describing the weather especially when the locality gets
  put into the pot. The Folkestone Washer Women is one of the terms that is used
  to describe the heavy rain clouds that chase in from the English Channel and
  if you get caught out in one of their wash days you are in for a soaking. The
  old signal box at Folkestone Harbour station just before a wash day and before
  the redevelopment of this area. I remember as a child standing on the pier
  watching the boat trains arrive, one particular time I saw a girl about my age
  in a smart coat with a little suitcase by her feet, how exotic I thought as I
  dreamed about her destination.

  I doubt it will snow 
  but I donâ€™t really know
  Gales could blow from the east
  bringing the beast
  or blow from the north 
  hurling chill winds forth
  Milder air from the south 
  and rain from the west might follow
  the North Downs hilly crest
  Then again, making it pour
  we could endure the 
  Folkestone washer-women 
  doing their chores

  However the weathervane spins
  the child in us finds wings
  and revels in the drama it brings.
