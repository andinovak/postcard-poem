poem: |
  Autumn skies change day by day
  Summer has finally given way
  Bursts of orange, hues of brown
  Leaves everywhere tumbling down
  The dirt is soft and easy to dig
  Time to play with fallen twigs
  Watch the dog race indoors with
  muddy coat and muddy paws.

  Billowing clouds start to race
  Windy weather sets a pace
  Gusts to knock you off your feet
  sending bins down the street
  Watch the dog chase his tail
  Calm the dog's playful spell.

Autumn always delivers such vibrant colours in nature. It is as if it is setting itself on fire, going out in a blaze of glory before the winter takes hold. The days are getting shorter and colder and the garden starts putting itself to sleep.
