poem: |-
  Long days of summer sun
  Gardens full of life and fun
  Roses show exquisite fare 
  Lavender lingers in the air
  Gentle butterflies are dancing
  Watchful eyes are glancing
  Hear the bird's timeless chatter
  Watch the dog run and scatter.

  Blue skies give way to grey
  Summer storms are on the way
  Big fat raindrops warm and round
  Quench the garden's dusty shroud
  Listen in anticipation 
  Wait for the escalation
  Calm the dogâ€™s trepidation.
