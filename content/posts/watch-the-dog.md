  Long days of summer sun
  Gardens full of life and fun
  Roses show exquisite fare 
  Lavender lingers in the air
  Gentle butterflies are dancing
  Watchful eyes are glancing
  Hear the birds timeless chatter
  Watch the dog run and scatter.

  Blue skies give way to grey
  Summer storms on the way
  Big fat raindrops warm and round
  Quench the gardens dusty shroud
  Listen in anticipation 
  Wait for the escalation
  Calm the dogâ€™s trepidation.

  Autumn skies change day by day
  Summer has finally given way
  Bursts of orange, hues of brown
  Leaves are everywhere tumbling down
  Time to chase, time to play before
  winter sweeps them all away
  Watch the dog race indoors with
  muddy coat and muddy paws.

  The darkest greys the clearest blues 
  Winter skies have many hues
  Naked trees stand tall and bold
  Watchful over winters hold
  Many plants are now sleeping
  while the earth is slowly breathing
  Hear the quiet, feel the calm
  Embrace the dog's sleepy charms.

  Spring tumbles forth without restraint
  The gardens have no complaint
  Colours are fresh all is green
  Everywhere joy to be seen
  Hear the birds renewed natter
  Watch the dog try and scatter
  Smell the air, smell the earth 
  Revelling in delightful mirth.
