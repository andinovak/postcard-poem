  Thereâ€™s a certain excitement as the sun starts 
  to rise chasing the dark from the night 
  time sky what will the bay reveal today?
  Who will enjoy what is on display?

  Fisherman casting out for a catch
  Canoeists passing by with a splash
  A Metal detectorist looking for a find
  Families rock pooling, and walkers, all kinds

  Shrimpers sweeping with wide nets
  A man with a trolley, not sure what he collects
  Swimmers embracing the cold of the sea
  sometimes the tide just up to their knees

  The lone photographer watching the show
  Most chase their pursuits for an hour or so
  As the bay disappears they pack up and go.
