  Kingsdown beach, is one of my favourite places, especially during low spring
  tides. The bay comes to life with visitors during this time, engaging in all
  sorts of activities and as the tide comes back in they seem to magically
  disappear. Now you might think that the small figure sitting on the chalk
  rocks near the middle of the photo is the lone photographer, but no, it was
  actually a lady sitting to guard a suspected unexploded device. Her friend had
  spied it the day before and reported it. The tide had hidden it with sand
  again and they wanted to warn others to tread carefully. How brave was that?

  Thereâ€™s a certain buzz
  as the sun starts to rise 
  chasing the dark from the nighttime sky
  What will the low tide reveal today?
  Who will enjoy the expansive bay?
  There's
  Fisherman casting out with a splash
  Canoeists passing by in a dash
  A Metal detectorist looking for a find
  Families rock pooling, and walkers, all kinds
  Shrimpers sweeping with wide nets
  A man with a trolley, bait digging I expect
  Swimmers embracing the cold of the sea
  sometimes the tide just up to their knees

  The lone photographer watching the show

  Most chase their pursuits for an hour or so
  As the bay disappears they pack up and go.
