title: Watching the Show
description: "Kingsdown Beach, is one of my favourite places, especially during
  low spring tides. It use to be that I would wander about the bay and not see
  anyone else. These days the bay comes to life with visitors during this time,
  engaging in all sorts of activities and as the tide predictably returns, one
  by one they disappear. "

poem: |
  There’s a certain excitement
  as the sun starts to rise 
  chasing the dark from the night sky
  This morning the tide is low in the bay
  Who will come out to explore and play

  Fisherman casting out with a splash
  Canoeists passing by in a dash
  A Metal detectorist looking for a find
  Families rock pooling, and walkers, all kinds
  Shrimpers sweeping with wide nets
  A man and a trolley, bait digging I expect
  Swimmers embracing the cold of the sea
  sometimes the tide just up to their knees

  The lone photographer watching the show.

  Most chase their pursuits for an hour or so…
  as the tide reappears most pack up and go.
