  Thereâ€™s a certain buzz
  as the sun starts to rise 
  chasing the dark from the nighttime sky
  What will the low tide reveal today?
  Who will enjoy the expansive bay?

  Fisherman casting out with a splash
  Canoeists passing by in a dash
  A Metal detectorist looking for a find
  Families rock pooling, and walkers, all kinds
  Shrimpers sweeping with wide nets
  A man with a trolley, bait digging I expect
  Swimmers embracing the cold of the sea
  sometimes the tide just up to their knees

  The lone photographer watching the show

  Most chase their pursuits for an hour or so
  As the bay disappears they pack up and go.
