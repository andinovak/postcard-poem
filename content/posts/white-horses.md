title: White Horses
description: "The sea has many faces, in Sandwich bay it can be for the most
  part charming but when a storm rolls in it can be whipped up into a frenzy.
  Looking out over the bay from Cliffsend, it is mesmerising to watch cascades
  of waves rolling in with the tide and on those windier days, white horse are
  seen aplenty galloping across the bay. "

  The waves are mesmerising today
  Crashing onshore in a rhythmic way.

  The other day they were full of rage
  a rage, of a storm
  that wouldnâ€™t conform.

  Outside the bay white horses paced
  waiting for the tide, to race, as the
  wave master let loose its stay
  White horses charged across the bay
  White salty manes, abounding
  In the surf, hooves pounding

  For now, the storm has eased and
  the horses have taken their leave.
