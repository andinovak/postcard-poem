title: White Horses
description: "The hovercraft have long gone, Pegwell Bay, is now a little bit of
  wilderness on our east Kent coast. When a storm rolls in, the sea can be
  whipped up into a frenzy, it is mesmerising to watch cascades of waves rolling
  in with the tide, and on those windy days, white horses are seen and heard
  aplenty galloping across the bay. "

poem: |-
  The waves are mesmerising today
  Rolling in a rhythmic way.

  The other day they were full of rage
  A rage whipped up by a storm 
  With winds that wouldn't conform.

  Outside the bay white horses paced
  waiting for the tide, to race, as the
  wave master let loose its stay
  White horses charged across the bay
  White salty manes, abounding
  In the surf, hooves pounding

  For now, the winds have eased and
  the horses have taken their leave.
