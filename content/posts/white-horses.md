poem: |
  The waves are mesmerising today
  Crashing onshore in a rhythmic way.

  The other day they were full of rage
  a rage, of a storm
  that wouldnâ€™t conform.

  Outside the bay white horses paced
  waiting for the tide, to race, as the
  wave master let loose its stay
  White horses charged across the bay
  White salty manes, abounding
  In the surf, hooves pounding

  For now, the storm has eased and
  the horses have taken their leave.
