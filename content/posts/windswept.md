poem: |-
  Windswept, looking out to sea
  that is me, a wild Hawthorn tree.

  Rooted atop the white cliffs, I wait
  for the easterly wind to shape my fate.

  Tangled, unruly, without much care
  my branches are wavy as maiden's hair.

  Seasons in turn try to tame my tresses
  gently coaxing with persistent caresses.

  Warmer months, tie a leafy green scarf
  which the wind tries to snatch away with a laugh.

  And as summer turns into autumn browns
  Sprigs of red berries are tied tight to my crown. 

  In winter, after the usual leaf loss
  my locks have braids of lichen and moss.

  Spring adorns me with garlands of white
  May blossom is the most wondrous sight.

  Despite all their efforts, 
  in nature's art
  I remain,
  Windswept, unruly, a wild child at heart.

Dotted over the white cliffs of Dover are some very hardy hawthorn trees. Their shapes are dictated by the prevailing easterly winds, giving them great character. I can almost imagine the faces of these trees laughing back at their adversary, the wind.
