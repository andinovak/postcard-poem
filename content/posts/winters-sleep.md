poem: |-
  Fallen leaves, twigs, gnarly bark.
  Skeleton trees, canopies stark
  Delicate lichens catch the light from  
  winters sun which is low and bright.

  Long thin shadows slowly stretch  
  weaving across the earthy bed.
  Soft moss, decaying matter.
  Birds flock with incessant chatter.

  Tortuous vines climb and cling
  an evergreen coat on aged limbs.
  Trees stand tall and fast as
  ferocious winds whine and grasp.

  Jack frost chills, fresh snow stills,
  A woodland steeped in hibernation 
  veiled from winters altercation.

Woodland Tapestries is a collection of photographs and poems showcasing our wonderful woodlands. I had this romantic notion that our woodlands were being woven on an ancient woodland loom, each season taking it in turn to weave its finest colours. Here is winter tending to the loom.
Discover more woodland tapestries as we transition through the year.
