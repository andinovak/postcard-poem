  The darkest greys the clearest blues 
  Winter skies have many hues
  Naked trees stand tall and bold
  Watchful over winter’s hold
  Many plants are now sleeping as
  the earth has slowed its breathing 
  Time to dream behind closed doors
  Watch the dog’s twitching paws

  The air is cold, the sun is low
  everywhere is white with snow
  Time for gloves time for scarfs
  Hear the dogs excited bark
  waiting for walks in the park
