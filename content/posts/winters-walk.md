title: Watch the Dog Winters Walk
description: >-
  We reconnect with our faithful friend on a winter walk. The garden in winter
  is quite bare, a few hellebores have started flowering and some snowdrops are
  beginning to show their green tips through the soil, the grass is supporting
  an untold count of worm casts making it a muddy place to be. Time to explore
  our beautiful parks.

  Kearsney parks are home to some very fine beech trees, you have to admire the way they hold onto their autumn leaves throughout the winter, looking after their new leaf shoots until the spring and only when the new shoots are ready will they drop their old leaves.

poem: |-
  The darkest greys the clearest blues 
  Winter skies have many hues
  Naked trees stand tall and bold
  Watchful over winters hold
  Many plants are now sleeping as
  the earth has slowed its breathing 
  Time to dream behind closed doors
  Watch the dogs twitching paws

  The air is cold, the sun is low
  everywhere is white with snow
  Time for gloves time for scarfs
  Hear the dog's playful bark
  excited for walks in the park.
