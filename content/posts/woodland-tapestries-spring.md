poem: |-
  Spring warps and wefts 
  its vibrant threads
  all around colour spreads
  A splash of yellow, a haze of blue
  pinks and whites, cheerful views.

  Woodland flowers embrace the sun 
  while the canopy above is young.
  Leaf buds burst fresh and bright
  Birds, purposeful in song and flight.
  Little creatures tentatively roam 
  further from their winter homes.

  A woodland eagerly awakening 
  welcoming nature, rejuvenating.

Woodland Tapestries is a collection of photographs and poems showcasing our wonderful woodlands. I had this romantic notion that our woodlands were being woven on an ancient woodland loom, each season taking it in turn to weave its finest colours. As the woodland loom begins to wake we get 'Springs Splash'  Discover more woodland tapestries as we transition through the year.
