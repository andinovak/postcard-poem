title: "Woods are Great "
description: >-
  Woods are great in every season, some woods are good for wildflowers and
  butterflies others for weird fungi and chestnuts and then some woods are good
  for getting lost in. 

  I like to think the trees listen to everything, storing away anecdotes to dream about during a long winter's hibernation.

  Kings Wood near Ashford is a particularly magnificent wood matching its grand name.

  Woods are great for hugging trees 
  for running around and grazing knees
  For spending time with family and friends 
  Searching for sticks and making dens
  For finding a bright sunny glade and then 
  walking back into the dark cool shade 
  For making you think no one else is around 
  as the soft woodland floor muffles sound but 
  if the undergrowth were to rustle you would 
  pretend you weren't scared with soft chuckles
  For vivid imaginations and tales whispered
  mindful that trees are very good listeners.
