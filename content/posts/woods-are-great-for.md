title: Woods are Great For;
description: >-
  Many happy days spent in the woods in every season, some woods are good for
  wild flowers and butterflies others for weird fungi and chestnuts and then
  there are those for getting lost in. 

  The trees take centre stage of course, I like to think they listen to everything, storing away anecdotes to keep them amused through a long winters hibernation.

  Kings Wood near Ashford is a particularly magnificent wood  matching its grand name and is great for all the things listed in the poem.

poem: |-
  Woods are great for hugging trees 
  for running through and grazing knees
  For messing about with family and friends 
  finding sticks and making dens.
  For standing quiet when a bird startles and 
  also when the undergrowth rustles 
  then pretending you weren't scared 
  with soft deep chuckles
  For vivid imaginations and for sharing tales 
  Stories told in hushed whispers, mindful 
  that the trees are very good listeners.
