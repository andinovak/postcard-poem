title: "Woods are Great "
description: >-
  Woods are great in every season, some woods are good for wildflowers and
  butterflies others for weird fungi and chestnuts and then some woods are good
  for getting lost in. 

  I like to think the trees listen to everything, storing away anecdotes to dream about through a long winter's hibernation.

  Kings Wood near Ashford is a particularly magnificent wood matching its grand name and is great for all the things listed in the poem.

  Woods are great for hugging trees 
  for running through and grazing knees
  For messing about with family and friends 
  finding sticks and making dens
  For standing quiet when a bird startles and 
  also when the undergrowth rustles 
  then pretending 'like' you weren't scared 
  with soft deep chuckles
  For vivid imaginations and for sharing tales 
  tales told in hushed whispers, mindful 
  that the trees are very good listeners.
