title: "Woods are Great "
description: >-
  Woods are great in every season, some woods are good for wildflowers and
  butterflies others for weird fungi and chestnuts and then some woods are good
  for getting lost in. 

  I like to think the trees listen to everything, storing away anecdotes to dream about during a long winter's hibernation.

  Kings Wood near Ashford is a particularly magnificent wood matching its grand name.

  Woods are great for hugging trees 
  for running around and grazing knees
  For spending time with family and friends 
  Searching for sticks and making dens
  For finding a bright sunny glade and then 
  walking back into the dark cool shade 
  For making you think no one else is around 
  as leafy matter muffles all sound but when
  the undergrowth suddenly rustles you pretend 
  you weren't scared with soft deep chuckles
  For vivid imaginations and tales told in whispers
  mindful that the trees are very good listeners.
