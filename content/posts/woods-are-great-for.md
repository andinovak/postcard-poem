title: "Woods are Great "
description: >-
  Woods are great in every season, some woods are good for wildflowers and
  butterflies others for weird fungi and chestnuts and then some woods are good
  for getting lost in. 

  I like to think the trees listen to everything, storing away anecdotes to dream about through a long winter's hibernation.

  Kings Wood near Ashford is a particularly magnificent wood matching its grand name.

  Woods are great for hugging trees 
  for running through and grazed knees
  Spending time with family and friends 
  Searching for sticks and making dens
  Wide open rides, narrow twisting paths

  For standing still when the undergrowth rustles 
  pretending you weren't scared with chuckles
  For vivid imaginations and tales told in whispers
  mindful that the trees are very good listeners.
