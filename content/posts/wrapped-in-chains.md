title: Wrapped in Chains
description: "Grain Napoleonic Tower stands defiant where the River Medway meets
  the Thames. Built as part of a defence system to protect from a perceived
  French naval attack. It was added to and used during both world wars. The
  massive chain once used in defence across the estuary is wrapped around the
  tower slowly rusting away. The Tower stands alone battling the elements. "

  Wrapped in chains
  Alone
  Outcast
  Flanked by the river's tidal paths
  Once a proud defender, requisite
  Time has rendered it obsolete

  Defiant in defeat, Grain tower
  exploits the tide's daily retreat
  Luring visitors to its historical scene 
  On a path of bricks covered in green
  But be aware the mudflats are thick 
  and the roving tides like to play tricks.
