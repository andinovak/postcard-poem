title: Wrapped in Chains
description: >-
  Grain Napoleonic Tower stands defiant where the River Medway meets the Thames.
  Built as part of a defence system to protect from a perceived French naval
  attack. It was added to and used during both world wars. The massive chain
  once used in defence across the estuary is wrapped around the tower slowly
  rusting away. 

  Today the tower stands alone, the only battle it faces is a constant battle against the elements.

  Wrapped in chains
  Alone
  Outcast
  Flanked by the river's tidal paths
  Once a proud defender, requisite
  Time has rendered it obsolete

  Grain tower, defiant in defeat
  exploits the tide's daily retreat

  Luring visitors to its historical scene 
  Across a path, a slippery green
  But be aware the mudflats are thick 
  and the roving tides like to play tricks.
