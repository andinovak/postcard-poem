  Wrapped in chains
  Alone
  Outcast
  Flanked by the river's tidal paths
  Once a proud defender, requisite
  Time has rendered it obsolete

  Grain tower, defiant in defeat
  Exploits the tide's daily retreat
  Luring visitors to its historical scene 
  On a path of bricks covered in green
  But be aware the mudflats are thick 
  and the roving tides like to play tricks.
